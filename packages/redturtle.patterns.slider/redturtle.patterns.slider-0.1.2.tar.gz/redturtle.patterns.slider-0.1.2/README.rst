redturtle.patterns.slider
==============================================================================

A pattern based on Plone Mockup that enable a slick slider on a selected div.

http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/

Documentation
-------------


Installation
------------

Install redturtle.patterns.slider by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        redturtle.patterns.slider


and then running ``bin/buildout``

After that, you need to install it in your Plone site from the control panel.

Pattern usage
-------------

This pattern follows slick's standards, so you need a div with a list of items.

To enable the pattern in a div, you just need to add 'pat-slider' class to it:

.. code::

  <div class="pat-slider">
  ...
  </div>

There is a set of default parameters for the slider:

- dots: true
- slidesToShow: 4
- slidesToScroll: 4
- arrows: true
- lazyLoad: 'ondemand'

If you want to change something, you only need to add an additional configuration (mockup-style) to your div like this:

.. code::

  <div class="pat-slider"
       data-pat-slider="dots: false; arrows: false">
  ...
  </div>

JS Development and bundling
---------------------------

If you need to develop this product's javascripts or styles, you need to compile the code
for the resource registry bundle. To do this, there are two grunt tasks.

First of all, you need to install grunt dependencies listed in package.json file in the root of this package:

.. code::

  npm install


After that, you can use two different grunt tasks:

- `grunt`: the default task, that listen files changes with `watch` and re-build resources and bundles automatically
- `grunt compile`: to manually compile all resources and bundles
