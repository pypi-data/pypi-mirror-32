        =======================
        
        
        This is a simple PyScaffold extension which serves as a blueprint.
        It's sole purpose is to create a ``pyproject.toml`` file according to `[PEP 518]`_.
        This extension was bootstrapped with PyScaffold::
        
            putup pyscaffoldext-pyproject -p pyproject --namespace pyscaffoldext --no-skeleton
        
        Read more about creating an extension under http://pyscaffold.org/.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Just install this package and note that ``putup -h`` shows a new option ``--pyproject``.
        Using this will create a default ``pyproject.toml``.
