Prepare and upload Docker images for use by BeeKeeper.

Quickstart
----------

Create a directory, and in that directory place a `Dockerfile`, along with any
files required by the `Dockerfile`.

Optionally, you can also put an `ecs.json` file in the directory. The
`ecs.json` file should contains a JSON definition of any ECR container
settings that you want task to have. For example, if you wanted to specify a
particular memory and CPU usage profile for the task, you would specify::

    {
        memory: 50,
        cpu: 8192
    }

These settings will be used as overrides for the default container settings
used by BeeKeeper.

Then, create a file named `.env` in your current working directory that contains
the following content::

    AWS_REGION=<Your AWS region (e.g., us-west-2)>
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<Your AWS access key>
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<Your AWS secret access key>

Then, run::

    $ waggle <path to docker image directory>

This will:

* Log into AWS ECR
* Find (or create) an AWS ECR repository for your image
* Build the Docker image
* Tag the image for publication to AWS ECR
* Push the image to AWS ECR
* Register (or update) an AWS ECS task that uses the image.

If your Docker image is contained in a directory called `myimage`, your
BeeKeeper configuration will now be able to reference a task image of
`myimage`.


Testing
-------

Before you waggle your task, you're probably going to want to test it.


* To build an image locally::

    $ cd <directory with a Dockerfile in it>
    $ docker build -t <namespace>/<image> .

* To run an image locally::

    $ docker run <namespace>/<image>

  If your docker image requires environment variables (all the Beekeeper ones do),
  you may find it easier to put all those variables in a file (e.g., `.env`),
  and run::

    $ docker run --env-file=.env <namespace>/<image>

  To temporarily define a variable for the duration of the test::

    $ VARIABLE=value docker run -e VARIABLE <namespace>/<image>

  To mount a local directory as the source code directory::

    $ docker run -v `pwd`:/app/src <namespace>/<image>

* To start the container with an interactive prompt:

    $ docker run -it --env-file=.env <namespace>/<image> /bin/bash

* To clean up afterwards, run::

    $ docker ps -a

  to list all the containers that have been executed, and::

    $ docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

  to remove all the stale containers.
