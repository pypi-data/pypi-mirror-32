        ## Installation
        
        Install `node` and `npm`. We would encourage you to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) a version manager for node.
        
        You need `node > 5`
        
        Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
        
        ## Development Server
        
        Run `npm start` to start the development server. Visit your browser at `http://localhost:8080` to see the result.
        
        ## Testing
        
        During development run `npm run test:watch` to run tests on every file change.  
        
        Run `npm test` to run the full test suite with code coverage report.  
        
        ## Building
        
        - Building is done via webpack and the command is `npm build`  
        - The dist folder is where the minified versions of these files are stored.  
        
        ## Deployment to GH-pages
        
        Automated deployment via travis is enabled for the master branch. 
        
        If you want to deploy manually to gh-pages use `npm run deploy`
        
        ### Important
        The deplyoment uses the `index-gh.html` please keep this file in sync with `index.html` and change the path once the repo changes it's name. The `.travis.yml` needs to be changed as well.
        
        ## Integrating into GeoNode/Django
        
        - Add `django-geonode-mapstore-client` to your requirements.txt
        - Add `geonode-mapstore-client` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`
        
        ### For GeoNode
        Update your `settings.py` as follows:
        
        ```
        # To enable the MapStore2 based Client enable those
        if 'geonode_mapstore_client' not in INSTALLED_APPS:
            INSTALLED_APPS += ('geonode_mapstore_client', )
        GEONODE_CLIENT_LAYER_PREVIEW_LIBRARY = 'mapstore'  # DEPRECATED use HOOKSET instead
        GEONODE_CLIENT_HOOKSET = "geonode_mapstore_client.hooksets.MapStoreHookSet"
        ```
        
        ### For Django
        We added templatetags you can use in your templates
        
        - Add `{% client_viewer_js %}` to include the viewer javasricpt
        - Add `{% client_composer_js %}` to include the composer javasricpt
        
        The following templates are available:
        
        `client_map_view_html` for the full map view
        
        `client_map_detail_view_html` for a smaller map view (as in the map preview)
        
        `client_map_new_html` create a new map with composer
