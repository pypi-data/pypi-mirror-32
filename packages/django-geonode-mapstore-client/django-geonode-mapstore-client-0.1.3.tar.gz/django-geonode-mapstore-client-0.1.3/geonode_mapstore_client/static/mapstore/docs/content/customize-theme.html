<hr />
<p>The look and feel is completely customizable either using one of the included themes, or building your own. Themes are built using <a href="http://lesscss.org/">less</a>.<br>You can find the default theme here: <a href="https://github.com/geosolutions-it/MapStore2/tree/master/web/client/themes/default">https://github.com/geosolutions-it/MapStore2/tree/master/web/client/themes/default</a></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/geosolutions-it/MapStore2/tree/master/web/client/themes">themes folder</a> you can also find other ones that you can study.</p>
<p>To add a new theme:</p>
<ol>
<li>create a new folder in the themes folder with the name of your theme</li>
<li>create less files in the folder (at least <code>theme.less</code>, the main file, and <code>variables.less</code>, to customize standard variables)</li>
<li>add the new theme to the <a href="https://github.com/geosolutions-it/MapStore2/blob/master/web/client/themes/index.js">index file</a>, with the id corresponding to the theme folder name</li>
</ol>
<p>You can then switch your application to use the theme adding a new section in the <code>appConfig.js</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>initialState: {
    defaultState: {
        ...
        theme: {
            selectedTheme: {
                id: &lt;your theme id&gt;
            }
        },
        ...
     }
}
</code></pre></body></html>
