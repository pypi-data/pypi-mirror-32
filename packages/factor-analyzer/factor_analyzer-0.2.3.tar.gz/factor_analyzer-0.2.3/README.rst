This is a Python module to perform exploratory factor analysis, with
optional varimax and promax rotations. Estimation can be performed using
a minimum residual (minres) solution, or maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE).

Portions of this code are ported from the excellent R library ``psych``.

Please see the `official documentation <http://factor-analyzer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__ for additional details.


Description
-----------

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a statistical technique used to
identify latent relationships among sets of observed variables in a
dataset. In particular, EFA seeks to model a large set of observed
variables as linear combinations of some smaller set of unobserved,
latent factors.

The matrix of weights, or factor loadings, generated from an EFA model
describes the underlying relationships between each variable and the
latent factors. Typically, a number of factors (K) is selected such that
it is substantially smaller than the number of variables. The factor
analysis model can be estimated using a variety of standard estimation
methods, including but not limited to OLS, minres, or MLE.

Factor loadings are similar to standardized regression coefficients, and
variables with higher loadings on a particular factor can be interpreted
as explaining a larger proportion of the variation in that factor. In
many cases, factor loading matrices are rotated after the factor
analysis model is estimated in order to produce a simpler, more
interpretable structure to identify which variables are loading on a
particular factor.

Two common types of rotations are:

1. The **varimax** rotation, which rotates the factor loading matrix so
   as to maximize the sum of the variance of squared loadings, while
   preserving the orthogonality of the loading matrix.

2. The **promax** rotation, a method for oblique rotation, which builds
   upon the varimax rotation, but ultimately allows factors to become
   correlated.

This package includes a stand-alone Python module with a ``FactorAnalyzer()``
class. The class includes an ``analyze()`` method that allows users to perform
factor analysis using either minres or MLE, with optional rotations on the factor
loading matrices. The package also offers a stand-alone ``Rotator()`` class to
perform common rotations on an unrotated loading matrix.
