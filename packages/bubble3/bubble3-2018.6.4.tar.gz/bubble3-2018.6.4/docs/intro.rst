Read the Fine Documentation
---------------------------

Before you start reading this document, you should have read the fine online
`bubble documentation`_ to understand how :pypi:`bubble` works.

The 'manual' version of this documentation is available through the "bubble manual".

Motto for the documentation:
 -There is no such thing as too much documentation.
 -Too much documentation will not kill,except only when it's printed and dropped on your head.

You are reading this far already, great!


There will be lots of examples represented in features,
these features are actually the behaviour of the bubble tool has been fixated and tested during the development.
These features are not meant to make water tight testing of the tool.
But meant as a flexible harnas around the tool, with as little testing code as possible.


Any help on making this documentation more friendly will be highly appreciated

Wanna help out with bubble.
