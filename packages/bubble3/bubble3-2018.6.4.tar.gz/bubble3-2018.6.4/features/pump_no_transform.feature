Scenario: Given a target and no transform in configuration
    Given a new working directory
    When I run "bubble3 init"
    Then the command output should contain "Bubble initialized"
    Given a file named "./config/config.yaml" with:
            """
            ---
            CFG:
                BUBBLE:
