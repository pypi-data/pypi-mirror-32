        GUI window to easily run your own frequently used commands
        
        Installation
        ============
        Install from pypi using pip::
        
           pip install command-center
        
        Usage
        =====

           $ pcc
        
        Options
        =======
        
        Columns
        -------
        You can change the number of columns that command center will display by
        including a ``--col=N`` argument.::
        
           $ pcc --col=4
        
        Extra Commands
        --------------
        You can include additional commands for only the next execution by including
        key value pair arguments such as ``key=value``. Note that unless your key and
        value do not include spacing you will need to double quote the argument.::
        
           $ pcc "pytest abc=pytest a/b/c.py -x"
