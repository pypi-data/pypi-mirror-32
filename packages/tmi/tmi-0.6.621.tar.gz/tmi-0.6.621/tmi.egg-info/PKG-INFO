        ## Installation ##
        > This software recommends you to use PyPI.(In fact, this is only way)

        ```sh
        sudo pip install tmi

        If you are using a virtualenv, you may want to avoid using sudo:
        
        ```sh
        pip install tmi
        ```
        
        - **Alternatively: install TMI from the GitHub source:**
        
        First, clone TMI using `git`:
        
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/onnoo/TMI.git
        ```
