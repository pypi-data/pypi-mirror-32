That's basically the whole point of this library.

Usage
#####
The usage is similar to `sqlite3` with a few exceptions.

There is no cursor()
--------------------
You never have to use cursors. `s3m.Connection` object is completely self-sufficient, it has the methods of both a connection and a cursor.

Connections can be freely shared between threads (given `check_same_thread=False`)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple threads can use the same connection at the same time without any problems, that is, assuming that the connection was created with `check_same_thread=False`.
