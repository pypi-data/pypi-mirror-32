        S3M prevents multiple database operations (or transactions, can be disabled) from running at once.
        That's basically the whole point of this library.

        Usage
        #####
        The usage is similar to `sqlite3` with a few exceptions.
        
        There is no cursor()
        --------------------
        You never have to use cursors. `s3m.Connection` object is completely self-sufficient, it has the methods of both a connection and a cursor.
        
        Connections can be freely shared between threads (given `check_same_thread=False`)
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Multiple threads can use the same connection at the same time without any problems, that is, assuming that the connection was created with `check_same_thread=False`.
