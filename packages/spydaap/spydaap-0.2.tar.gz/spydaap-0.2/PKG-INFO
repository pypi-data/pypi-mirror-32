        Spydaap is a media server supporting the DAAP protocol (aka iTunes
        sharing). It is written in Python, uses the mutagen media metadata
        library, and either the Avahi or python-zeroconf implementation.
        
        Features:
        
         - Runs on Unix-like systems (Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X).
         - Can stream mp3s, ogg, flac, and Quicktime videos.
         - Supports "smart" playlists written in Python.
         - Written in 100 percent Python and easily modifiable.
         - Caches almost everything for fast performance.
         - Embeddable.
        
        Note: This pypi package is maintained by the Exaile project, but will be kept in
        sync with the upstream spydaap project.
