'''
The **entry** interface class definition. Use it as a template.

This module defines the class :class:`entryInterface` that will be instantiated by the
main gateway module.
Any other code needed for the interface can be placed here or in other
modules, as long as the necessary imports are included of course.

class entryInterface(object):
    '''
    Doesn't do anything but provides a template.

    The minimum requirement for the interface class is to define 2 public
    methods:

    - the constructor ``__init__`` which takes 4 arguments,
    - the ``loop`` method.

    Args:
        params (dictionary of strings): contains all the options from the configuration file
            This dictionary is initialised by the ``[INTERFACE]`` section in
            the configuration file.  All the options in that section generate an
            entry in the dictionary. Use this to pass parameters from the configuration
            file to the interface, for example the name of a port, or the speed
            of a serial communication.
        msgls (pair of lists of :class:`internalMsg` objects): these lists
            represent the communication *bus* with the core of the
            application. The first list should contain the incoming messages to
            process by this interface, and the second list can be used to
            send messages from this interface to the core application (and
            subsequently to the MQTT network).  The elements of these lists
            should be instantiations of the :class:`internalMsg` class.  Use the
            method ``pop(0)`` to read the lists on a FIFO basis and
            the method ``append(msg)`` to fill the lists.
            The constructor should assign these lists to a local attribute
            that the other methods of this class can use when needed.
            It is strongly advised to *empty* the incoming list at the beginning of
            the process.  The gateway will empty all messages of the outgoing
            list and attempt to send them to the MQTT system.
            The main reason to keep 2 lists instead of one is to simplify
            sending statuses while processing incoming commands one by one.
        path (string): the full absolute path of the launcher script
            This path can be used to extract the name of the application
            or the directory where it is located.  It can be useful to
            the ``logging`` library to allow proper hierarchical logging
            or to other functions that need to find data files relative to
            the launcher script location.
