'''
Representation of the Audio-Video system, including non-MusicCast devices.

The initialisation process is separated in 2 steps:

#. Load the static data from a JSON file into a local hierarchy made of
   a single system with devices that each have zones, sources and feeds.

#. Attempt to retrieve *live* data from all the MusicCast devices
   and initialise various parameters based on this data.  In case of failure,
   the retrieval of the information is delayed and the functionality of the
   device is not available until it goes back *online*.

The execution of a command is triggered by a lambda function retrieved from the
ACTIONS dictionary (done within the loop in the `musiccast_interface` module).
These lambda functions are methods called from a :class:`Zone` objects that
perform all the steps to execute these actions, including sending the actual
requests to the devices over HTTP (through the `musiccast_comm` module).

    This class loads the *static* data into local attributes from the JSON file.  Some checks are
    performed. Configuration errors coming from a bad description of the system in the file are
    fatal.

    Then it retrieves MusicCast parameters from the MusicCast devices through HTTP requests.  In
    case of connection errors, the device concerned is put in a *not ready* state, and its update
    delayed.
