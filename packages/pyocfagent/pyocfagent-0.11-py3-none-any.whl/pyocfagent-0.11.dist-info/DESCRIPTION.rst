This is a Python OCF Cluster Resource Agent Framework for implementing OCF Resource Agents in Python. It allows you to implement a OCF compatible resource agent for Pacemaker with pure Python logic. Most Resource agents are implemented as Shell Scripts (see Debian Package resource-agents for examples). The pyocfagent allows you to implement such resource agents directly in Python. The framework creates resource agent meta-data on the fly from your source code by introspection of your derived Pyhon class.
