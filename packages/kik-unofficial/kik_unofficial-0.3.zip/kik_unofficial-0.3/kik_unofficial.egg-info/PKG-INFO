Description: Kik Bot API
        ===========
        
        Use this library to develop bots for `Kik Messenger`_ that are
        essentially automated humans.
        
        It basically lets you do the same things as the offical Kik app by
        pretending to be a real smartphone client: It communicates with Kik’s
        servers at ``talk1110an.kik.com:5223`` over a modified version of the
        `XMPP`_ protocol. 
        
        Installation and dependencies
        -----
        
        First, make sure you are using **Python 3.4**, not python 2.7. Second, just clone it with
        ``git``:
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/tomer8007/kik-bot-api-unofficial
        
        And install with ``pip``:
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install ./kik-bot-unofficial-api
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        An example is worth a thoursand words. a good place to start is the
        ``examples/`` directory.
        
        It is as simple as:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from kik_unofficial.kikclient import KikClient
            username, password = "your_kik_username", "your_kik_password"
            kik = KikClient(username, password)
            kik.send_message("other_kik_username", "Hello from bot!")
        
        Currently Supported Operations: - Log in with kik username and password,
        retrieve user information (such as email, name, etc). - Fetch chat
        partners information - Send text messages to
        users:raw-latex:`\groups `and listen for incoming messages - Send and
        receive ‘is-typing’ status - Send and receive read receipts - Fetch
        group information (name, participants, etc.) - Receive media content:
        camera, gallery, stickets - Add a kik user as a friend
        
        Sending multimedia (images, videos) is not suported yet.
        
        Troubleshooting
        ---------------
        
        If you are on Windows and you are unable to install the lxml pacakge,
        use the binary installers from PyPi `here`_.
