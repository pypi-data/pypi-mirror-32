        What is tabler?
        ===============
        
        The tabler package provides the Table class which is intended to make the creation and maniplulation of tabulated data intuitive.
        
        It can:
            + Open various spreadsheet files from a relative path, absolute path or url.
            + Update text in cells.
            + Write files in various formats.
        
        Compatible formats:
            + .csv
            + Open Spreadsheet Format .ods
            + Microsoft Excel .xlsx
            + HTML (Write only)
            + Other filetypes can be added by subclassing the BaseTableType class.
        
        Quick Start
        ===========
        
        Creating a Table (Basic)
        ________________________
        
        Import the Tabler class from the tabler package and instanciate it with a header and data::
        
            from tabler import Table
        
            table = Tabler(
                header=['SKU', 'Item Title', 'Price'],
                data=[[009, 'Item 1', 5.00], [010, 'Item 2', 9.99]])
        
        Or pass the path to a file to open::
        
            from tabler import Table
        
            Table('path/to/some/file.csv')
        
        This will recognise filetypes with the following extensions:
            + .csv (UTF-8 encoded and comma delimited).
            + .txt (UTF-8 encoded and comma delimited).
            + .xlsx
            + .ods
        
        To explicitly open a file of a specifict type a Table Type object must be provided.::
        
            from tabler import Table
            from tabler.tabletypes import CSV
        
            Table('path/to/some/file.csv', table_type=CSV(delimiter='\t'))
        
        These are subclasses of ``BaseTableType`` and allow the method of reading the file to be customised.
        
        
        Reading a Table (Basic)
        _______________________
        
        At its base, Tabler is a two dimensional ``list``. Therefore the simplest way to access a cell is by providing two indexes::
        
            first_cell = table[0][0]
        
        Rows can be indexed by row number (zero based)
        Tabler will always treat the first line of any supplied data as column headers.
        This means that a column can be specified by index number or title::
        
            first_item_title = table[0]["Item Title"]
        
        Editing a Table (Basic)
        _______________________
        
        A cell can be edited using the equals ``=`` operator::
        
            table[2]["Item Title"] = 'USB Hub'
        
        Cell content can be ``string``, ``int`` or ``float``.
        
        Loading Data into a Table (Basic)
        _________________________________
        
        Data can be loaded into an empty Tabler object by passing a ``list`` of rows in the form of ``lists`` of cell data using the ``Tabler().load_from_array(data, header)`` method. A ``list`` of column headers must be passed as the second argument::
        
            header = ["SKU", "Item Title", "Price"]
        
            data = [
                ["001", "USB Hub", 7.00],
                ["002", "Raspberry Pi 3", 29.99],
                ["003", Arduino Uno", 20.00]
            ]
        
            table = Tabler()
            table.load_from_array(data, header)
        
        Writing a Table to a File (Basic)
        _________________________________
        
        Writing a file is similar to reading a file. ``Table Types`` are used in the same way to manage writing files::
        
            table.write('path/to/save.csv', table_type=CSV(delimiter='\t')
        
        The ``table type`` will be set automatically for reconised file extensions if not explicitly set.
