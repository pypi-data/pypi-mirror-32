What is tabler?
===============

The tabler package provides the Table class which is intended to make the creation and maniplulation of tabulated data intuitive.

It can:
    + Open various spreadsheet files from a relative path, absolute path or url.
    + Update text in cells.
    + Write files in various formats.

Compatible formats:
    + .csv
    + Open Spreadsheet Format .ods
    + Microsoft Excel .xlsx
    + HTML (Write only)
    + Other filetypes can be added by subclassing the BaseTableType class.

Quick Start
===========

Creating a Table (Basic)
________________________

Import the Tabler class from the tabler package and instanciate it with a header and data::

    from tabler import Table

    table = Tabler(
        header=['SKU', 'Item Title', 'Price'],
        data=[[009, 'Item 1', 5.00], [010, 'Item 2', 9.99]])

Or pass the path to a file to open::

    from tabler import Table

    Table('path/to/some/file.csv')

This will recognise filetypes with the following extensions:
    + .csv (UTF-8 encoded and comma delimited).
    + .txt (UTF-8 encoded and comma delimited).
    + .xlsx
    + .ods

To explicitly open a file of a specifict type a Table Type object must be provided.::

    from tabler import Table
    from tabler.tabletypes import CSV

    Table('path/to/some/file.csv', table_type=CSV(delimiter='\t'))

These are subclasses of ``BaseTableType`` and allow the method of reading the file to be customised.


Reading a Table (Basic)
_______________________

At its base, Tabler is a two dimensional ``list``. Therefore the simplest way to access a cell is by providing two indexes::

    first_cell = table[0][0]

Rows can be indexed by row number (zero based)
Tabler will always treat the first line of any supplied data as column headers.
This means that a column can be specified by index number or title::

    first_item_title = table[0]["Item Title"]

Editing a Table (Basic)
_______________________

A cell can be edited using the equals ``=`` operator::

    table[2]["Item Title"] = 'USB Hub'

Cell content can be ``string``, ``int`` or ``float``.

Loading Data into a Table (Basic)
_________________________________

Data can be loaded into an empty Tabler object by passing a ``list`` of rows in the form of ``lists`` of cell data using the ``Tabler().load_from_array(data, header)`` method. A ``list`` of column headers must be passed as the second argument::

    header = ["SKU", "Item Title", "Price"]

    data = [
        ["001", "USB Hub", 7.00],
        ["002", "Raspberry Pi 3", 29.99],
        ["003", Arduino Uno", 20.00]
    ]

    table = Tabler()
    table.load_from_array(data, header)

Writing a Table to a File (Basic)
_________________________________

Writing a file is similar to reading a file. ``Table Types`` are used in the same way to manage writing files::

    table.write('path/to/save.csv', table_type=CSV(delimiter='\t')

The ``table type`` will be set automatically for reconised file extensions if not explicitly set.
