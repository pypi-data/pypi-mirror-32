fleaker.peewee.mixins.search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Module that provides a mixin that can do generic SQL ``LIKE`` queries. If more
complex searching is required, it is strongly recommended that the developer
looks into a searching technology, like ElasticSearch, instead of attempting to
make this more complex.

Example:
    To use this mixin, add it to the classes inheritance chain.

        from fleaker.peewee import SearchMixin

            title = peewee.CharField(max_length=255, null=False)
            body = peewee.TextField(null=False, default='')

            class Meta:
                # These are the default search fields for this model.
                search_fields = ('title', 'body')

        # Let's create a few posts for this blog
        Post.insert_many([
            {'title': 'Welcome!', body: 'Content'},
            {'title': 'Content is hard to write.', body: 'I am lazy.'},
            {'title': 'Hacked!', body: 'Some malcontent hacked this site!'},
        ])

        # Because all the Posts have the word 'content' in them, a search
        # should return all the posts.
        content_query = Posts.search('Content')

        assert content_query.count() == Posts.select().count()

        # The search query is ordered by relevance in this order:
        #
        # 1. Straight equality (``posts.body = 'Content'``)
        # 2. Right hand ``LIKE`` (``posts.body LIKE 'Content%')
        # 3. Substring ``LIKE`` (``posts.content LIKE %Content%``)
        #
        # The query's search term is applied to the query case insensitively.
        # It should also be noted that matches for title will be ordered above
        # matches for content because of the ordering in Meta.search_fields.
        content_posts = list(content_query)

        # Post.body was an exact match for 'Content'
        assert content_posts[0].title == 'Welcome!'

        # Post.title had content in the title.
        assert content_posts[0].title == 'Content is hard to write.'

        # Post.body was a right hand substring of 'Content'
        assert content_posts[2].title == 'Goodbye!'

        # Post.body had the word 'Content' in there somewhere.
        assert content_posts[3].title == 'Hacked!'

        # The search method can overload the searched fields by providing it's
        # own list.
        hacked_search = Post.search('hacked', fields=('title',))

        assert goodbye_search.count() == 1
