fleaker.peewee.mixins.time.pendulum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Module that implements mixins that provide timestamp accounting for models. The
only difference between this model and class:`fleaker.peewee.mixins.time.base`
is that the timestamps are class:`pendulum.datetime.DateTime` objects.

Example:
    To use these mixins, add the class to the model's inheritance chain.

    .. code-block:: python

        import peewee

        from fleaker import db
        from fleaker.peewee import PendulumArchivedMixin

        class User(PendulumArchivedMixin, db.Model):
            name = peewee.CharField()
            # This model is now setup to keep track of when a User is created,
            # modified, and has archiving capabilities.

        user = User(name="Bobby Tables")
        user.save()

        # Created is set upon the first save, but modified isn't set until the
        # first update. Archived isn't set until the record has been archived.
        assert user.created
        assert not user.modified
        assert not user.archived

        user.name = "Tom Hanks"
        user.save()

        # User was updated, so the modified timestamp is set.
        assert user.modified
        assert not user.archived

        # The ArchivedMixin provides methods to archive records.
        user.archive_instance()

        # Archiving will set the archived timestamp. It is guaranteed that the
        # archived timestamp and the modified will be equal upon that update.
        assert user.archived
        assert user.archived == user.modified

        # Records can be unarchived without any issues.
        user.unarchive_instance()

        # Which will just unset the archived timestamp.
        assert not user.archived
