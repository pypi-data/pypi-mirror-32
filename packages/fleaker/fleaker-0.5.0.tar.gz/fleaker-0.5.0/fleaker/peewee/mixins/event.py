fleaker.peewee.mixins.event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module provides a set of Peewee mixins that can be used for activity and
auditing tracking transparently with Peewee's event system. For example, using
the typical file system example, say you need to keep track of who created and
then modified a Folder. You could hack together inflexible code to meet this
criteria, sure. But then you need to keep track of who created and modified
a File. The second you introduce auditing into your system, you might as well
keep track of everything and this mixin allows for that quite easily!

There are two mixins in this module, the ``EventMixin`` and the
``EventStorageMixin``. The ``EventMixin`` should be placed into models in which
tracking the changes upon is desirable. The ``EventStorageMixin`` should be
provided to a model in order to track the activity in the system.

Because of how Peewee's event system works, event tracking only works when an
instance is created/updated using :func:`peewee.Model.save` or deleted using
:func:`peewee.Model.delete_instance`.

Since Fleaker does not provide migrations of any sort, you must create the
Event storage table yourself. Here is some SQL to create the bare essentials
for Event storage. Be sure to add foreign keys to the tables you'd like to
track the events for.

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE TABLE `events` (
        `body` TEXT NULL,
        `code` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'AUDIT',
        `version` VARCHAR(255) NULL,
        -- Feel free to use a JSON field or a text field, depending on your
        -- database of choice.
        `meta` JSON NULL,
        `original` JSON NULL,
        `updated` JSON NOT NULL,
        `model` VARCHAR(255) NULL,
        `created` DATETIME NOT NULL,
        `modified` DATETIME NULL
    )

Example:
    To use these mixins, add their classes to the model's inheritance chain. In
    this example, we will be using a file system with a User operating upon it.
    The goal of this example is to keep track of File and Folder movements,
    File and Folder creation, and File and Folder deletion. In all events
    created, we will keep track of the User causing these Events.
