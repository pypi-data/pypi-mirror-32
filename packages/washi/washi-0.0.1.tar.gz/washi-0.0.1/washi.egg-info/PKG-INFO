Description: # Washi
        
        Washi is a command line interface for organizing scientific research.  Yes, there are electronic lab notebooks out there.  However, most researchers still end up with a mess of unorganized data files on their computer.  
        
        ## How it works
        Washi organizes each experiment your run into the following folder structure:
        
            EXPINFO.md
            setup/
            data/
            analysis/
        
        - EXPINFO.md is like a readme.  It describes the experiment, maybe has pictures of your lab notebook, etc.
        - The setup/ directory is for everything you do before the experiment (e.g., dilution calculations in excel, import literature references)
        - The data/ directory is for RAW data.  That means the raw csv files coming of the your HPLC, spectrometer or whatever you use. This should not be processed.
        - The analysis/ directory is for processed data and the scripts used to get that data. 
        
        
        ## Usage 
        
        To create a washi folder structure
        
            washi init
