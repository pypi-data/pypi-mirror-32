        ===========================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Provides plugin for ``VmShepherd`` - driver allows to store runtime data and lock management in Zookeeper.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Simply use ``pip``.
        
        :: 
        
            pip install vmshepherd-zookeeper-driver
        
        
        Library requires (as well as VmShepherd itself) python 3.6 or later.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Install package (in the same environment as VmShepherd) and configure ``VmShepherd`` like:
        
        ::
        
            # ...
        
            runtime:
              driver: ZookeeperDriver
              servers:
               - some.zk.host
              working_path: /vmshepherd
              addauth:
                auth: vmshepherduser:password
