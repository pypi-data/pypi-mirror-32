# sorted-mkdn

A small utility that processes awesome-list markdown and does in-place sort of lists based on star counts. This works against [Awesome React Native](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native), and can probably be used on similarly formatted lists.

## Quick Start

Install:

```
$ pip install sorted-mkdn
```

And run

```
$ sorted-mkdn README.md > README_SORTED.md
```
