Description: # MCTS
        
        This package provides a simple way of using Monte Carlo Tree Search in any perfect information domain.  
        
        ## Installation 
        
        With pip: `pip install mcts`
        
        Without pip: Download the zip/tar.gz file of the [latest release](https://github.com/hildensia/mcts/releases), extract it, and run `python setup.py install`
        
        ## Quick Usage
        
        In order to run MCTS, you must implement a `State` class which can fully describe the state of the world.  It must also implement four methods: 
        
        - `getPossibleActions()`: Returns an iterable of all actions which can be taken from this state
        - `takeAction(action)`: Returns the state which results from taking action `action`
        - `isTerminal()`: Returns whether this state is a terminal state
        - `getReward()`: Returns the reward for this state.  Only needed for terminal states. 
        
        You must also choose a hashable representation for an action as used in `getPossibleActions` and `takeAction`.  Typically this would be a class with a custom `__hash__` method, but it could also simply be a tuple or a string.  
        
        Once these have been implemented, running MCTS is as simple as initializing your starting state, then running:
        
        ```python
        mcts = mcts.mcts(timeLimit=1000)
        bestAction = mcts.search(initialState=initialState)
        ```
