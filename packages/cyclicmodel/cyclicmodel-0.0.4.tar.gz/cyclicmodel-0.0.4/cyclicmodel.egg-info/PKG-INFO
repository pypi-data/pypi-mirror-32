Description: # cyclicmodel
        Statistical causal discovery based on cyclic model.  
        This project is under development.
        
        ## Summary
        Python package that performs statistical causal discovery
        under the following condition:
        1. there are unobserved common factors
        2. two-way causal relationship exists
        
        `cyclicmodel` has been developed based on
        [`bmlingam`][4670f282], which implemented bayesian mixed LiNGAM.

        ## Example
        ```Python
        import numpy as np
        import pymc3 as pm
        import cyclicmodel as cym
        
        # Generate synthetic data,
        # which assumes causal relation from x1 to x2
        n = 200
        x1 = np.random.randn(n)
        x2 = x1 + np.random.uniform(low=-0.5, high=0.5, size=n)
        xs = np.vstack([x1, x2]).T
        
        # Model settings
        hyper_params = cym.define_model.CyclicModelParams(
            dist_std_noise='log_normal',
            df_indvdl=8.0,
            dist_l_cov_21='uniform, -0.9, 0.9',
            dist_scale_indvdl='uniform, 0.1, 1.0',
            dist_beta_noise='uniform, 0.5, 6.0')
        
        # Generate PyMC3 model
        model = cym.define_model.get_pm3_model(xs, hyper_params, verbose=10)
        
        # Run variational inference with PyMC3
        with model:
          fit = pm.FullRankADVI().fit(n=100000)
          trace = fit.sample(1000, include_transformed=True)
        
        # Check the posterior mean of the coefficients
        print(np.mean(trace['b_21']))  # from x1 to x2
        print(np.mean(trace['b_12']))  # from x2 to x1
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        ```bash
        pip install cyclicmodel
        ```
