# FinnTK

Some simple high level tools for processing Finnish text.

This project is according to my personal preferences but might be
helpful to others, particularly for exploratory coding. For larger projects you may prefer to use [OMorFi](https://github.com/flammie/omorfi) directly.

## Installation ##

This project assumes you've installed HFST and OMorFi system-wide, like so:

  $ PIP_IGNORE_INSTALLED=1 pipenv install --site-packages finntk

Part of the reason for this is because [HFST is not currently pip installable](https://github.com/hfst/hfst/issues/375).

The current known good versions of HFST and OMorFi are in installed with Docker in the `docker` directory.

## Development ##

### Release process ###

1. Make a release commit in which the version is incremented in setup.py

2. Make a git tag of this commit with `git tag v$VERSION`

3. Upload to PyPI with `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` and `twine upload dist/*`
