Installing PyDIM
================

Requirements
============

- DIM. The package has been developed using the v16rXX, v17rXX and v18r0 DIM 
   versions. It has not been tested with older versions but it has good chances
   to work.
- Python >= 2.3
- The package has been developed on both 32 and 64 bits architectures.


Installing from the RPM package
===============================

The recommended way of installing PyDIM is through the RPM package ``pydim``.

The package is found in the AFS repository and is available for SLC4 and SLC5.
It should be installed automatically by Yum, although here is the location of
the actual RPM files::

    /afs/cern.ch/lhcb/project/web/online/online-rpm-repo/slc4X/i386/RPMS/
    /afs/cern.ch/lhcb/project/web/online/online-rpm-repo/slc5X/x86_64/

The source RPM packages are also available in the following locations::

    /afs/cern.ch/lhcb/project/web/online/online-rpm-repo/slc4X/SRPMS/
    /afs/cern.ch/lhcb/project/web/online/online-rpm-repo/slc5X/SRPMS/

Install the right version according to your operating system and the hardware
architecture.

The ``pydim`` package depends on ``dim`` and ``python`` packages. On the other
hand, for building the source package the header files are required, these are
included in the packages ``python-devel`` and ``dim-devel``.

Installing from source
======================

You also can install PyDIM from the source. In order to do that you will need
to have DIM with its header files, either by installing the RPM packages or
by doing manually. If you opt for a manual installation, it's recommended to 
put the DIM libraries and header files in the *standard* locations for your 
operating system and architecture. Usually, they are ``/usr/local/lib`` and
``/usr/local/include`` respectively.

Please make the necessary changes so that the run-time linker finds 
``libdim.so`` (basically add an entry in ``/etc/ld.so.conf`` that points to
the DIM library directory). Make sure that the DIM library is built using the
*same* compiler and architecture as the Python installation you want to use.

For installing and running PyDIM you must follow these steps.

1. Source code
--------------

Get the latest version of PyDIM from the CERN Central Subversion Service.
There is a web interface for browsing the code::

    https://svnweb.cern.ch/world/wsvn/lhcbonline/PyDIM/trunk

You can get a local working copy for reading or, if you have access, making
modifications to the code. To get a read-only copy use the following command::

    svn co https://svnweb.cern.ch/guest/lhcbonline/PyDIM/trunk

Within CERN you can get write access using SSH authentication::

    svn co svn+ssh://svn/reps/lhcbonline/PyDIM/trunk


2. Install script
-----------------

Run the installation script (you may want to run it as root)::
 
    $ python setup.py install

3. Environment variables
------------------------
        
In the general case this should take care of building the library.

In case DIM libraries are not found, declare an environment variable named
``DIMDIR``, ``DIMHOME`` or ``DIM_HOME`` pointing to the main DIM installation 
directory, i.e. the one that contains the sub-directories `dim` and the 
specific one for your operating system, e.g. `linux`.


Building the documentation
--------------------------

The PyDIM documentation uses `Sphinx`_ for generating pretty HTML files. 

You can download it with the `easy_install`_ utility::

    easy_install -U Sphinx

Once Sphinx is installed use the ``Makefile`` in the ``docs/guide`` directory,
for example::

    $ make html

For other commands please refer to the `Sphinx documentation`_.


Test the installation
=====================

TODO: TBD.
