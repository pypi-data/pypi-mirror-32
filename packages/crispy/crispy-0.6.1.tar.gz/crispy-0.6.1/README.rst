Crispy is a modern graphical user interface to calculate core-level spectra using the semi-empirical multiplet approaches implemented in `Quanty <http://quanty.org>`_. The interface provides a set of tools to generate input files, submit calculations, and plot the resulting spectra.

Installation
============

Latest Release
--------------

Windows and macOS
*****************
The easiest way to install Crispy is to use the installers provided on the project `downloads <http://www.esrf.eu/computing/scientific/crispy/downloads.html>`_ page. The installers bundle Python, the required dependencies, and Crispy. However, because for the moment they are only created when a new release is published, they might lack newly implemented features. 

All Operating Systems
*********************
If you already have Python and all dependencies installed (see below), you can install Crispy using the Python package manager, pip:

.. code:: sh

    pip install crispy --upgrade [--user]

Just as in the case of using the package installers, this will install the latest release, and not the development version (see below). Also, please note that when you install Crispy using pip, external programs needed to run the calculations have to be installed and their path must be set in the interface (preferred way) or using the PATH environment variable.

Development Version
-------------------
First you have to make sure that you have a working Python distribution. If this is not the case, you will need to install it. While Crispy works with both Python 2 and Python 3, you should install Python 3.5 or greater, as in previous versions some of the dependencies like PyQt5 cannot be easily installed using pip. On macOS and Windows you can install Python using the `official <https://www.python.org/downloads>`_ installers. In particular for Windows you should install the 64-bit version of Python, and make sure that during the installation you select to add Python to system's PATH. On Linux, Python and dependencies can be installed using the system's package manager (apt-get, dnf, pacman, etc.).

Crispy depends on the following Python packages:

* `PyQt5 <https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro>`_
* `numpy <http://numpy.org>`_
* `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`_
* `silx <http://www.silx.org>`_

The dependencies can be installed using pip (only for Python 3.5 or greater):

.. code:: sh

    pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mretegan/crispy/master/requirements.txt [--user]

It is possible, although unlikely, that the development version of Crispy requires features that are not yet available with the pip installable version of silx. In this case you have to also install the development version of silx. This is not always a very simple task, especially on Windows, but there is extensive `documentation <http://www.silx.org/doc/silx/latest>`_ on how to do it.

Once Python and all dependencies are installed, you can proceed to installing Crispy:

.. code:: sh

    pip install https://github.com/mretegan/crispy/tarball/master --upgrade [--user]

Usage
=====

.. forth-marker

If you have used the installers, Crispy should be easy to find and launch. For the installation using pip you can start Crispy from the command prompt using:

.. code:: sh

    crispy

This a file created during the installation that should be available from the command line if the PATH environment variable was set correctly during the initial Python installation.
