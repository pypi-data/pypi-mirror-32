Description: libhomegear-python
        ==================
        
        libhomegear-python is a python extension to connect to Homegear over Unix Domain Sockets. It supports all of Homegear's RPC methods and live event reception.
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        The extension requires `libhomegear-ipc` to be installed. To install it, add the Homegear APT repository for your distribution (see https://homegear.eu/downloads.html) and execute
        
        ```
        apt install libhomegear-ipc
        ```
        
        ## Setup
        
        To compile and install the extension manually, execute
        
        ```
        sudo python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Methods
        
        There is only one object available: `Homegear`. It takes two parameters in it's constructor: The path to the Homegear IPC socket (`/var/run/homegear/homegearIPC.sock` by default) and a callback method. The callback method is executed when a device variable is updated in Homegear. On instantiation the class waits until it is connected succesfully to Homegear. After 2 seconds it returns even if there is no connection. To check, if the object is still connected, you can call `connected()`. Apart from this method, you can call all RPC methods available in Homegear.
        
        ## Usage example
        
        A minimal example:
        
        ```
        from homegear import Homegear
        
        # This callback method is called on Homegear variable changes
        def eventHandler(peerId, channel, variableName, value):
        	# Note that the event handler is called by a different thread than the main thread. I. e. thread synchronization is
        	# needed when you access non local variables.
        	print(peerId, channel, variableName, value);
        
        hg = Homegear("/var/run/homegear/homegearIPC.sock", eventHandler);
        ```
        
        Please note that the callback method is called from a different thread. Please use thread synchronization when accessing shared variables.
        
        To execute a RPC method, just type `hg.<method name>`. For example to set the system variable "TEST" to "6" and retrieve it again:
        
        ```
        hg.setSystemVariable("TEST", 6);
        print(hg.getSystemVariable("TEST"));
        ```
        
        See Examply.py for a full example.
