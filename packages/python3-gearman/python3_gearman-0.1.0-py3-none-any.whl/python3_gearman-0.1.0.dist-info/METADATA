Description
===========
Python 3 Gearman API - Client, worker, and admin client interfaces

For information on Gearman and a C-based Gearman server, see http://www.gearman.org/

Since the current `gearman` module is with Python versions <=
2.7 and no longer in active development, this package was created. 
The vast majority of the work here was from folks at Yelp and other 
contributors (see Authors.txt). This package was based off an initial clone of 
the `gearman` package, tag `v2.0.2`. Python3-compatible fixes to core classes 
and functions were brought in from https://github.com/msjaiswal/python3-gearman. 
In addition, python3 updates to the unit tests were also included. Moreover, 
TravisCI functionality was brought in to automate
building and testing. 

Installation
============
* easy_install python3_gearman
