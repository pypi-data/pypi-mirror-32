Intake: A general interface for loading data
============================================

Intake is a lightweight set of tools for loading and sharing data in data science projects.
Intake helps you:

* Load data from a variety of formats (see :ref:`plugin-directory`) into containers you already use, like Pandas dataframes, Python lists, NumPy arrays, and more.
* Read data catalogs and actual data from remote/cloud storage
* Translate your boilerplate data loading code into reusable Intake plugins
* Describe data sets in catalog files for easy reuse and sharing between projects and with others.
* Share catalog information (and data sets) over the network with the Intake server
