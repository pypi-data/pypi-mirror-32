[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ashcrow/flask-track-usage.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ashcrow/flask-track-usage)

Basic metrics tracking for the Flask framework. This focuses more on ip addresses/locations rather than tracking specific users pathing through an application. No extra cookies or javascript is used for usage tracking.
