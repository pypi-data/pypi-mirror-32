Description: Raschii
        =======
        
        Raschii is a Python library for constructing non-linear regular waves and is
        named after `Thysanoessa raschii
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thysanoessa_raschii>`_, the Arctic Krill.
        
        Supported wave models are currently:
        
        - Stream function waves (M. M. Rienecker and J. D. Fenton, 1981)
        - Stokes second through fifth order waves (based on J. D. Fenton, 1985) 
        - Airy waves, standard linar waves cosine waves
        
        Raschii includes a command line program to plot regular waves from the suported
        wave models and C++ code generation for using the results in other programs, 
        such as in `FEniCS <https://www.fenicsproject.org/>`_ expressions for initial
        and boundary conditions in a FEM solver. There is also a limited `Dart port
        <https://bitbucket.org/trlandet/raschiidart>`_ which is used in the `online demo
        <https://raschii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/raschii_dart.html>`_.

        Installation and running
        ------------------------
        
        Raschii can be installed by running::
        
            python3 -m pip install raschii
            
        This will also install dependencies like numpy.
        
        An example of using Raschii from Python::
        
            import raschii
            
            fwave = raschii.FentonWave(height=0.25, depth=0.5, length=2.0, N=20)
            print(fwave.surface_elevation(x=0))
            print(fwave.surface_elevation(x=[0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3]))
            print(fwave.velocity(x=0, z=0.2))
        
        This will output::
        
            [0.67352456]
            [0.67352456 0.61795882 0.57230232 0.53352878]
            [[0.27263788 0.        ]]

        Development
        -----------
        
        Raschii is developed in Python on `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/trlandet/raschii>`_
        by use of the Git version control system. If you are reading this on github,
        please be aware that you are seeing a mirror that could potentially be months
        out of date. All pull requests and issues should go to the Bitbucket repository.
        
        Raschii is automatically tested on `CircleCI <https://circleci.com/bb/trlandet/raschii/tree/master>`_  
        and the current CI build status is |circleci_status|.
