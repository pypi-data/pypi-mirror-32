Description: TensorSpace
        ===========
        
        TensorSpace is a reference implementation of an artificial intelligence lab.
        
        Why?
        ~~~~
        
        I was tired of setting up ad hoc environments for various research experiments. I wanted a solution that can turn any "computer" into a research environment that I can use right away.
        
        Features
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        * Downloads and normalizes datasets. Currently only COCO, but more coming. Saves everything into a nice organized directory structure.
        * Single annotation schema for all datasets. You don't need to research with just one dataset at a time anymore. You do queries like "give me all images with bounding boxes from all datasets". 
        * Automatically preprocess vectors or other intermidate datasets.
        * **Coming soon**: Demos and models that use the data.
        * **Coming soon**: GraphQL API for running models
        * **Coming soon**: Multiple deployment targets. This will include Kubernetes.
