Description: General binary file parser
        ==========================
        
        This library provides general binary file parsing by interpreting documentation
        of a file structure and data types. By default, it supports basic data types
        like big-endian and little-endian integers, floats and doubles, variable length
        (delimited) strings, maps and bit fields (flags) and it can iterate over sub
        structures. Other data types are easily added.
        
        The file structure and the types are stored in nested dictionaries. The
        structure is separated from the types, this way multiple file formats using the
        same types (within one project for example) can be easily supported without
        much duplication.
        
        The design of the library is such that all operations can be reversed. This
        means that fully functional binary editing is possible using this
        implementation; first use the reader to convert a binary file to a serialised
        dictionary representation, this representation is easily edited using a text
        editor, and then use the writer to convert back to binary.
        
        This idea is implemented in two languages; Python and JavaScript. All main
        development is done in Python. We chose YAML as our preferred serialised
        dictionary format, but other serialisation formats (JSON for example) can be
        used too.
