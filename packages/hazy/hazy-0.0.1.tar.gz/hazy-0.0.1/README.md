# Hazy Toolbelt

The Hazy Toolbelt is a command line interface (CLI) tool for managing and anonymising data with [Hazy](https://hazy.com).

It's developed in Python and the code is published under the [MIT License](https://github.com/hazy-ai/toolbelt/blob/master/LICENSE) at [github.com/hazy-ai/toolbelt](https://github.com/anon-ai/toolbelt).

## Status - WIP

This version of the toolbelt is being re-written with a new command structure to work with the second version of the Hazy console.

It's not ready to use yet.
