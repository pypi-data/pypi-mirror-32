**wolfSSL Python**, a.k.a. ``wolfssl`` is a Python module
that encapsulates `wolfSSL's SSL/TLS library
<https://wolfssl.com/wolfSSL/Products-wolfssl.html>`_.

**wolfSSL's SSL/TLS library** is a lightweight, portable, C-language-based
library targeted at IoT, embedded, and RTOS environments primarily because of
its size, speed, and feature set. It works seamlessly in desktop, enterprise,
and cloud environments as well.
