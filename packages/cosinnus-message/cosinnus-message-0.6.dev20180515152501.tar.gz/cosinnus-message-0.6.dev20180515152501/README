.. note::

   Messages is a cosinnus app that lets users of a group write a message text for a group and automatically send it by email to some (or all) members of that group.
   
   It is currently WIP. Templates, Views, Forms and Models are implemented and recipients can be selected. The actual sending of the mail is stubbed and needs to be implemented. 
   
   See tickets for details.
