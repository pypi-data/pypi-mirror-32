def forward_pass(graph_object, seedmets):
    """
    This function carries out the Guided Breadth First Search on a directed
    bipartite graph starting from the entries in seed metabolite set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph_object : NetworkX DiGraph Object
        Bipartite graph of the metabolic network

    seedmets : set
        Set of seed metabolites including the source

    Returns
    -------
    lower_bound_metabolite : defaultdict
        Minimum number of steps required to reach a metabolite
    status_dict : defaultdict
        Dictionary pertaining to the status of every reaction - whether it
        has been visited or not
    scope : set
        Set of metabolites that can be produced from the given set of
        seed metabolites

    Notes
    -----
    Starting with the set of seed metabolites S, the algorithm first finds
    all the reactions from the set R, whose precursor metabolites are in S.
    Such reactions are marked visited and added to the visited reaction set.
    Metabolites produced by these reactions are checked. The reactions where
    these metabolites participate are then checked for the presence of all its
    predecessors and are added to the queue. This traversal continues in a
    breadth-first manner and stops when there are no further reactions to
    be visited.
