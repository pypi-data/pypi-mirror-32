Input
=====

Folder whose structure is as shown:

.. code-block:: text

    mainfolder/
    |-Example1/
    |   |-- SBML model(s) of metabolic networks # XML files of the metabolic networks(COBRA-compatible)
    |   |-- seed_mets.txt       # Text file containing the seed metabolites separated by a newline
    |   â”‚-- source_mets.txt     # Text file containing the source metabolites separated by a newline
    |   |-- target_mets.txt     # Text file containing the target metabolites separated by a newline
    |   |-- cutoff.txt          # Text file containing the size cut-offs separated by a newline  
    |-Example2/
    |   ...

Kindly ensure that the SBML model has the field <model id> and the metabolites
are prefixed with the model identifiers, for instance, if the model identifier is 
'ecoli_core_model', and the seed metabolite is 'fum_c', the input text file
should contain ecoli_core_model fum_c
