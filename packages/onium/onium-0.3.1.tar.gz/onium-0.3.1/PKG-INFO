Description: Onium - Inject hebrew support into slack destop app
        ===================================================
        
        This little utility is using Electron's debug API (Using chrome's debug
        API) to inject Chrome plugins into an Electron app. The code was
        developed to inject the Hebrew support (RTL) support into Slack, but the
        concept can be changed to other apps and plugins.
        
        What is Onium?
        --------------
        
        Onium is a tool to inject the Hebrew support chrome plugin into the
        slack desktop app. The tool was built to allow to inject any chrome
        plugin into electron, and will be changed in the future to support other
        electron apps.
        
        Onium uses Shlomi Matichin's excellent
        `slack\_hebrew <https://github.com/shlomimatichin/slack-hebrew>`__
        plugin.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        You need Python 2.7 or 3.5 or later to run Onium. Onium should work on
        Windows, Mac and Linux.

        ::
        
            $ python -m pip install onium
        
        As long as python's scripts folder is in your path, simply rung
        
        ::
        
            $ onium
