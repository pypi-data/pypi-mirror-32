Description:     This is the fax.plus API v1 developed for third party developers and organizations. In order to have a better coding experience with this API, let's quickly go through some points:
            - This API assumes **/accounts** as an entry point with the base url of **https://restapi.fax.plus/v1**.
            - This API treats all date and times sent to it in requests as **UTC**. Also, all dates and times returned in responses are in **UTC**
            - Once you have an access_token, you can easily send a request to the resource server with the base url of **https://restapi.fax.plus/v1** to access your permitted resources. As an example to get the user's profile info you would send a request to **https://restapi.fax.plus/v1/accounts/self** when **Authorization** header is set to "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" and custom header of **x-fax-clientid** is set to YOUR_CLIENT_ID
