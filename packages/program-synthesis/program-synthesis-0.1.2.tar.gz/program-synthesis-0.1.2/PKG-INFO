Description: # Program Synthesis
        NEAR Program Synthesis provides a set of models, tools, and datasets for program synthesis tasks.
        
        This repository will make it easier for the community to compare and reuse program synthesis algorithms across different
        datasets.
        
        ## Prerequisites
        Python 3 (>=3.5) is required to run the code. We also recommend using
        [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) for isolated Python environments and
        [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) for package management. Note, to create a Python 3 environment you need to run:
        
        ```
        virtualenv .env --python=python3
        source .env/bin/activate
        ```
        
        The code also assumes that [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is already installed.
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install program-synthesis
        ```
        
        ## Development installation
        
        For development installation you need to clone the repository:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/nearai/program_synthesis.git
        cd program_synthesis
        ```
        
        Install program-synthesis in editable mode:
        ```
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Models and datasets
