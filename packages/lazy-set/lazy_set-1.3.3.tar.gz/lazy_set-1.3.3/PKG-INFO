Description: # LazySet
        
        A collection that tries to imitate a "lazy" difference and union of sets:
        
        Given a base set, an iterable of sets to subtract from the base set, and an iterable of sets to now add to it
        (note that the order is important!), a LazySet will act exactly like a regular set and supports all the basic
        operations, but without actually performing any state-changing unions or differences to any of the participating
        sets (that take O(number of items in all sets)).
        
        Instead, the LazySet goes over all participating sets according to their order to check if an item is contained
        in it, thus giving a better run time in some cases for most operations. For example, if the LazySet used is after
        initialization and no modifying operations were used on it, containment checking takes O(number of participating sets).
