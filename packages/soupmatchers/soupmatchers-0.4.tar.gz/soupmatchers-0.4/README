Soupmatchers
============

This is a library to make writing tests for HTML content straightforward and
robust.

The naÃ¯ve way of doing this would be to do things such as assert that your HTML
contains the string

  >>> html = ('<a href="https://launchpad.net/testtools" '
  ...     'class="awesome">testtools <b>rocks</b></a>')

which can easily break if you make small changes such as adding a CSS class
which is irrelevant to the test, or your templating library changes to
sort attributes in alphabetical order.

Obviously working on the parse tree would be better, and BeautifulSoup is
part of the way to do that.

BeautifulSoup
-------------

  >>> import bs4
  >>> root = bs4.BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")

It is an HTML parsing library that includes
a way to search the document for matching tags. If you had a parsed
representation of your document you could find the above part by doing

  >>> import re
  >>> anchor_tags = root.find_all(
  ...    "a", attrs={"href": "https://launchpad.net/testtools",
  ...        "class": "awesome"})
  >>> print(anchor_tags)
  [<a class="awesome" href="https://launchpad.net/testtools">testtools <b>rocks</b></a>]

which would return you a list with (let's assume) a single entry, the
bs4.Tag for the <a>. You can locate the nested tag with:

  >>> anchor_tag = anchor_tags[0]
  >>> anchor_tag.find_all("b")
  [<b>rocks</b>]

which will again return a single item list.

While this is useful to be able to more robustly identify parts of the document
it doesn't exactly lend itself to testing. For that we need some methods for
checking a document against a specification.

Matchers
--------

Here's where the beauty of testtools comes in. Instead of providing yet
another TestCase subclass that you somehow have to work in to your test
class Hierarchy, we just define a set of testtools.Matcher classes.

If you use testtools then you can easily make use of these in your tests
with assertThat. If not then they have a simple interface that is easy to
make use of in your test classes.

Let's demonstrate.

First we'll show how to create a matcher that will check that our document
contains at least a link to the testtools Launchpad page, and this link
has a certain css class, and mentions testtools in the anchor text.

  >>> import soupmatchers
  >>> print(soupmatchers.Tag(
  ...     "link to testtols", "a",
  ...     attrs={"href": "https://launchpad.net/testtools",
  ...         "class": "awesome"}))
  Tag("link to testtols",
  <a class='awesome' href='https://launchpad.net/testtools' ...>...</a>)

This may look rather familiar.

Note that the text representation of the soupmatchers.Tag object isn't
what will be literally matched, it is just an attempt to express the things
that will be matched.

Further though, soupmatchers allows you to specify text that the
tag must contain to match.

  >>> print(soupmatchers.Tag(
  ...     "link to testtools", "a",
  ...     attrs={"href": "https://launchpad.net/testtools",
  ...            "class": "awesome"}, text=re.compile(r"testtools")))
  Tag("link to testtools",
  <a class='awesome' href='https://launchpad.net/testtools'
  ...>re.compile('testtools') ...</a>)

Now lets define a create a matcher that will match the bold tag from above.

  >>> print(soupmatchers.Tag("bold rocks", "b", text="rocks"))
  Tag("bold rocks", <b ...>rocks ...</b>)

Obviously this would allow the bold tag to be outside of the anchor tag, but
no fear, we can create a matcher that will check that one is inside the
other, simply use the Within matcher to combine the two.

  >>> print(soupmatchers.Within(
  ...     soupmatchers.Tag(
  ...         "link to testtools", "a",
  ...         attrs={"href": "https://launchpad.net/testtools",
  ...                "class": "awesome"}, text=re.compile(r"testtools")),
  ...     soupmatchers.Tag("bold rocks", "b", text="rocks")))
  Tag("bold rocks", <b ...>rocks ...</b>) within Tag("link to testtools",
  <a class='awesome' href='https://launchpad.net/testtools'
  ...>re.compile('testtools') ...</a>)

this will mean that the first matcher will only match if the second matcher
matches the part of the parse tree rooted at the first match.

These matchers are working on the parsed representation, but that doesn't
mean you have to go to the trouble of parsing every time you want to use
them. To simplify that you can use

  >>> print(soupmatchers.HTMLContains(
  ...     soupmatchers.Tag("some image", "image")))
  HTML contains [Tag("some image", <image ...>...</image>)]

to create a matcher that will parse the string before checking the tag
against it.

Given that you will often want to check multiple things about the HTML
you can pass multiple soupmatchers.Tag objects to the constructor of
soupmatchers.HTMLContains, and the resulting matcher will only match
if all of the passed matchers match.

Using Matchers
--------------

This hasn't explained how to use the matcher objects though, for that you
need to make use of their match() method.

  >>> import testtools
  >>> matcher = testtools.matchers.Equals(1)
  >>> match = matcher.match(1)
  >>> print(match)
  None

the returned match will be None if the matcher matches the content that
you passed, otherwise it will be a testtools.Mismatch object. To put
this in unittest language

  match = matcher.match(content)
  self.assertEquals(None, match)

or, if you subclass testtools.TestCase,

  self.assertThat(content, matcher)

Testing Responses
-----------------

For those that use a framework that has test response objects, you can even
go a step further and check the whole response in one go.

The soupmatchers.ResponseHas matcher class will check the response_code
attribute of the passed object against an expected value, and also check
the content attribute against any matcher you wish to specify.

  >>> print(soupmatchers.ResponseHas(
  ...     status_code=404,
  ...     content_matches=soupmatchers.HTMLContains(soupmatchers.Tag(
  ...         "an anchor", "a"))))
  ResponseHas(status_code=404, content_matches=HTML contains
  [Tag("an anchor", <a ...>...</a>)])

where the status_code parameter defaults to 200.

As working with HTML is very common, there's an easier way to write the
above.

  >>> print(soupmatchers.HTMLResponseHas(
  ...     status_code=404, html_matches=soupmatchers.Tag("an anchor", "a")))
  HTMLResponseHas(status_code=404, content_matches=HTML contains
  [Tag("an anchor", <a ...>...</a>)])

Later similar objects will be added for dealing with XML and JSON.

This matcher is designed to work with Django, but will work with any object
that has those two attributes.

Putting it all together we could do the original check using

  >>> class ExpectedResponse(object):
  ...     status_code = 200
  ...     content = html
  >>> class UnexpectedResponse(object):
  ...     status_code = 200
  ...     content = "<h1>This is some other response<h1>"

  >>> child_matcher = soupmatchers.Tag("bold rocks", "b", text="rocks")
  >>> anchor_matcher = soupmatchers.Tag(
  ...     "testtools link", "a",
  ...     attrs={"href": "https://launchpad.net/testtools",
  ...            "class": "awesome"},
  ...     text=re.compile(r"testtools"))
  >>> combined_matcher = soupmatchers.Within(anchor_matcher, child_matcher)
  >>> response_matcher = soupmatchers.HTMLResponseHas(
  ...     html_matches=combined_matcher)
  >>> #self.assertThat(response, response_matcher)
  >>> match = response_matcher.match(ExpectedResponse())
  >>> print(match)
  None
  >>> match = response_matcher.match(UnexpectedResponse())
  >>> print(repr(match)) #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
  <soupmatchers.TagMismatch object at ...>
  >>> print(match.describe())
  Matched 0 times
  Here is some information that may be useful:
    0 matches for "bold rocks" in the document.
    0 matches for "testtools link" in the document.

which while verbose is checking lots of things, while being maintainable
due to not being overly tied to particular textual output.

Checking the number of times a pattern is matched
-------------------------------------------------

Remember how find_all returned a list, and we just assumed that it only found
one tag in the example? Well, the matchers allow you to not just assume that,
they allow you to assert that. That means that you can assert that
a particular tag only occurs once by passing

  count=1

in the constructor.

  >>> tag_matcher = soupmatchers.Tag("testtools link", "a",
  ...    attrs={"href": "https://launchpad.net/testtools"}, count=1)
  >>> html_matcher = soupmatchers.HTMLContains(tag_matcher)
  >>> content = '<a href="https://launchpad.net/testtools"></a>'
  >>> match = html_matcher.match(content)
  >>> print(match)
  None
  >>> match = html_matcher.match(content * 2)
  >>> print(match.describe())
  Matched 2 times
  The matches were:
    <a href="https://launchpad.net/testtools"></a>
    <a href="https://launchpad.net/testtools"></a>

Similarly you can assert that a particular tag isn't present by
creating a soupmatchers.Tag with

  count=0

  >>> tag_matcher = soupmatchers.Tag("testtools link", "a",
  ...    attrs={"href": "https://launchpad.net/testtools"}, count=0)
  >>> html_matcher = soupmatchers.HTMLContains(tag_matcher)
  >>> content = '<a href="https://launchpad.net/testtools"></a>'
  >>> match = html_matcher.match(content)
  >>> print(match.describe())
  Matched 1 time
  The match was:
    <a href="https://launchpad.net/testtools"></a>

If you wish to assert only that a tag matches at least a given number of
times, or at most a given number of times, then you will have to propose
a change to the code to allow that.

Failure Messages
----------------

As Tag only specifies a pattern to match, when something goes wrong it is
hard to know what information will be useful to someone reading the output.

A bad thing to do is to print the entire HTML document, as it can often be
large and so obscure the failure message. Sometimes though looking at
the HTML is the best way to find the problem. For that reason the Mismatch
can provide the entire document to you. If you call get_details() on the
Mismatch you will get a dict that contains the html as the value for
the "html" key.

  >>> matcher = soupmatchers.HTMLContains(soupmatchers.Tag("bold", "b"))
  >>> mismatch = matcher.match("<image></image>")
  >>> print(list(mismatch.get_details().keys()))
  ['html']
  >>> print(''.join(list(mismatch.get_details()["html"].iter_text())))
  <image></image>

If you use assertThat then it will automatically call addDetails with this
information, so it is available to the TestResult. Your test runner can
then do something useful with this if it likes.

That leaves the question of what to print in the failure message though.

If there are any matches at all then you want to see the string that matched.
This is particularly useful when there are too many matches, but also when
you expect multiple matches, but less are found then knowing which matched
can narrow the search.

  >>> matcher = soupmatchers.HTMLContains(soupmatchers.Tag(
  ...        "no bold", "b", count=0))
  >>> mismatch = matcher.match("<b>rocks</b>")
  >>> print(mismatch.describe())
  Matched 1 time
  The match was:
      <b>rocks</b>

If there aren't enough matches then the failure message will attempt to
tell you about the closest matches, in the hope that one of them gives a
clue as to the problem.

  >>> matcher = soupmatchers.HTMLContains(
  ...    soupmatchers.Tag("testtools link", "a",
  ...        attrs={"href": "https://launchpad.net/testtools",
  ...               "class": "awesome"}))
  >>> mismatch = matcher.match(
  ...    "<a href='https://launchpad.net/testtools'></a>")
  >>> print(mismatch.describe())
  Matched 0 times
  Here is some information that may be useful:
     1 matches for "testtools link" when attribute class="awesome" is not a
     requirement.

  >>> matcher = soupmatchers.HTMLContains(
  ...    soupmatchers.Tag("bold rocks", "b", text="rocks"))
  >>> mismatch = matcher.match(
  ...    "<b>is awesome</b>")
  >>> print(mismatch.describe())
  Matched 0 times
  Here is some information that may be useful:
    1 matches for "bold rocks" when text="rocks" is not a requirement.

While this will often fail to tell you much that will help you diagnose the
problem it should be possible to write your matchers in such a way that the
output is generally useful.

Restricting matches to particular areas of the document
-------------------------------------------------------

Often you want to assert that some HTML is contained within a particular
part of the document. At the simplest level you may want to check that
the HTML is within the <body> tag.

It is possible to specify that some Tag is within another by combining
them in the Within matcher.

  >>> child_matcher = soupmatchers.Tag("bold rocks", "b", text="rocks")
  >>> body_matcher = soupmatchers.Tag("the body", "body")
  >>> matcher = soupmatchers.HTMLContains(
  ...     soupmatchers.Within(body_matcher, child_matcher))
  >>> print(matcher)
  HTML contains [Tag("bold rocks", <b ...>rocks ...</b>)
  within Tag("the body", <body ...>...</body>)]
  >>> mismatch = matcher.match("<b>rocks</b><body></body>")
  >>> print(mismatch.describe())
  Matched 0 times
  Here is some information that may be useful:
    1 matches for "bold rocks" in the document.
    1 matches for "the body" in the document.
