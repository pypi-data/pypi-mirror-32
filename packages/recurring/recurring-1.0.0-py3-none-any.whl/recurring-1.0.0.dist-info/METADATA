# Recurring
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jdodds/recurring.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jdodds/recurring) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/jdodds/recurring/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/jdodds/recurring?branch=master) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/recurring/badge/?version=latest)](https://recurring.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


This is a simple library for running a function or callable every N seconds. It's meant for applications that need to schedule small, self-contined callable(s) on a relatively long, potentially changing period . alive-checks, state snapshots, that sort of thing.

## Use this if:
+ You want to call something periodically over the lifetime of your application.
+ You want to be able to change the time between calls.
+ You want or need to avoid the overhead of `join`ing and `start`ing a thread every time. (up to 1/5 of a second according to my sample-size of one machine under no other load)
+ The stuff you're going to call isn't going to destroy machines if it's killed abruptly at the end of the application's life.

## This is probably not appropriate for your project if:
+ You're already using or likely will be using a fleshed-out concurrency framework.
+ You have many things you'd like to repeatedly schedule and run.
+ Your callables absolutely **must** execute some cleanup code to avoid disaster on kill.


This is not a library intended for top-level program composition.

## Usage:


    import recurring

    def stuff():
        # do stuff ...

    seconds_between_stuff = 30

    job = recurring.job(stuff, seconds_between_stuff)
    job.start()

    # ...

    seconds_between_stuff = 300000000 # this will be *from when rate is set*, not *from the next scheduled call*
    job.rate = seconds_between_stuff

    # ...

    # blocks until runner thread is dead, only upto timeout seconds if given. runner is a daemon thread under the heed
    # and will get killed when the rest of the process dies regardless.
    job.stop(optionally_some_timeout)
