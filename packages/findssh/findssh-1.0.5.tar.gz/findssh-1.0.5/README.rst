=======
findssh
=======
Platform-independent **Python >= 3.6** script that finds SSH servers (or other services with open ports) on an IPv4 subnet, WITHOUT NMAP.
Scans entire IPv4 subnet in less than 1 second using 100 threads via Python standard library
`concurrent.futures <https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html>`_.

:author: Michael Hirsch, Ph.D.

Install
=======
You can just run ``findssh.py`` directly, but to allow use from other programs, you can install by::

    pip install findssh

or from this repo::

    pip install -e .
    
It is expected that your default `python` version is at least 3.5, which was released in 2015.


Usage
=======
Takes about 40 seconds to scan an IPv4 subnet.

from Terminal::

  python findssh.py

or from within Python

.. code:: python

    import findssh

    findssh.run()


Command line options
---------------------

-s  checks the string from the server to attempt to verify the correct service has been found.
-t  timeout
-b  baseip (check other subnet besides your own)
-p  port
