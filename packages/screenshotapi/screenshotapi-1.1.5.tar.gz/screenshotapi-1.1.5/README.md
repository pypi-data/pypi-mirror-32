An API Client for ScreenshotAPI.io (www.screenshotapi.io)

Will perform a screenshot capture using ScreenshotAPI.io and store the resulting screenshot png file locally on disk given the path prefix specified in the `save_path` argument.

## Installation

```shell
pip install screenshotapi
```

## Usage
```python
import screenshotapi

screenshotapi.get_screenshot(
    apikey='get your free apikey at www.screenshotapi.io',
    capture_request = {
          'url': 'http://www.amazon.com',
          'viewport': '1200x800',
          'fullpage': False,
          'webdriver': 'firefox',
          'javascript': True,
          'fresh': False
        },
        save_path = './'
)
```

## Command Line Usage

The installer also provids a command line interface.  You can use it as follows.

```shell
  $ export SCREENSHOTAPI_KEY=your-key-goes-here
  $ screenshotapi --url http://amazon.com \
                  --viewport 1200x800 \
                  --webdriver firefox \
                  --save-path ./
```

Note that you can provide a `SCREENSHOTAPI_KEY` environment variable that can then be used for subsequent calls, or you can use an `--apikey` argument on each call.
