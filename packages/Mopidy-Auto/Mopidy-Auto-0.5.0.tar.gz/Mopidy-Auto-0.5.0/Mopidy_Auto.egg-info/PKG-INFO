        Mopidy extension to automate music playback based on time of day.
        
        Can be used in restaurants to play fitting music depending on time of day with no user input required.
        
        **Notice**
        
        - Only tested with *file://* backend.
        - This extension high-jacks many Mopidy events to control playback so it does not play well with other extensions.
        
        Consists of a frontend and simple web client.
        
        Frontend
        ========
        
        If no tracks are playing and a play event is received, or if playback ends, a random album will be added to the
        tracklist and playback started.
        
        Album is chosen from one of 3 sections, based on time of day. After an album has been played, it will not play again
        until all other albums in it's section has been played.
        
        If volume is set higher than what is configured for the section, it will be lowered before playback starts.
        
        Web Client
        ==========
        
        The web client is reached on url `/auto/`. It shows which track, artist and album is playing.
        
        It has 3 buttons: **Play / Pause**, skip to **next track** and skip to **next album**.
        
        It also has a volume control.
        
        By logging in with admin key current playing track or album can be deleted.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install by running::
        
            pip install Mopidy-Auto
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Before starting Mopidy, you must add configuration for
        Mopidy-Auto to your Mopidy configuration file::
        
          [auto]
          enabled = true
        
          # Key required to access admin section
          admin_key = 123
        
          # URI where the sections folders are located. Should be same as '[file] media_dirs'
          base_path = file:///media/Music/
        
          # Max number of tracks that can be added from one folder. Set to 0 or lower to disable limit
          max_tracks = 15
        
          # Sections of different music activated depending on time of day. Currently locked to 3
          # At what time this section gets active
          s0_start = 00:00
          # Folder name in where to find albums
          s0_folder = Rap
          # Decrease volume to this level if it is set higher when new folder is being played
          s0_max_volume = 50
        
          s1_start = 11:00
          s1_folder = Trip Hop
          s1_max_volume = 80
        
          s2_start = 18:30
          s2_folder = Rock
          s2_max_volume = 80
        
        
        Recommend File backend configuration
        ====================================
        
        To make sure playback does not stop due to file types unhandled by Mopidy this exclude works well::
        
          [file]
          ...
          excluded_file_extensions =
