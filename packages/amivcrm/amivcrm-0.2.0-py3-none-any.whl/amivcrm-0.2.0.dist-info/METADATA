# Connector to the AMIV SugarCRM

SugarCRM provides a SOAP and a REST api. At the time this tool was written
the REST api was unfortunately not available. Therefore SOAP is used.

The python library suds is used, more exactly the fork by
[jurko](https://bitbucket.org/jurko/suds).

## Installation

```
pip install amivcrm
```

## Usage

You will need a soap username and password. You can find them in the
[AMIV Wiki](wiki.amiv.ethz.ch/SugarCRM#SOAP).
After you got the credentials, its as easy as this:

```
from amivcrm import AMIVCRM

CRM = AMIVCRM(username, password)
# Optional: Specify `url` and/or `appname`
# CRM = AMIVCRM(username, password, url="...", appname="...")

# Get Companies
CRM.get('Accounts')

# Select only certain fields
# Filter and order with SQL statements
CRM.get('Accounts',
    # Only companies participating in job fair
    query="accounts_cstm.messeteilnahme_c = 1",
    # Order alphabetically
    order_by="accounts.name",
    # Return Name and ID only
    select_fields=['name', 'id'])

# Get a single company by id
CRM.getentry('Accounts', '505404b1-1851-1472-d63e-4d829377e30b',
             # Optional: Limit the returned fields as well
             select_fields=['name'])

# Get a company only if  modified after given date
entry_id = '505404b1-1851-1472-d63e-4d829377e30b'
date = '2016-03-20 08:05:39'
# Be careful to use quotes in query
query = ("accounts.id = '%s' and accounts.date_modified >= '%s'"
         % (entry_id, date))
CRM.get('Accounts', query=query)
```
