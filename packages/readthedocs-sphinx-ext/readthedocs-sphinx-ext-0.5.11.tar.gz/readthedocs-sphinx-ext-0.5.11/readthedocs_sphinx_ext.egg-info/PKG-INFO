Description: Read the Docs Sphinx Extensions
        ===============================
        
        This module adds extensions that make Sphinx easier to use.
        Some of them require Read the Docs features,
        others are just code that we ship and enable during builds on Read the Docs.
        
        We currently ship:
        
        * An extension for building docs like Read the Docs
        * ``template-meta`` - Allows users to specify template overrides in per-page context.
