        The number of client-side attacks has grown significantly in the past few years
        shifting focus on poorly protected vulnerable clients. Just as the most known
        honeypot technologies enable research into server-side attacks, honeyclients
        allow the study of client-side attacks.
        
        A complement to honeypots, a honeyclient is a tool designed to mimic the behavior
        of a user-driven network client application, such as a web browser, and be
        exploited by an attacker's content.
        
        Thug is a Python low-interaction honeyclient aimed at mimicing the behavior of a
        web browser in order to detect and emulate malicious contents.
