Description: uAMQP for Python
        ================
        
        An AMQP 1.0 client library for Python.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Wheels are provided for most major operating systems, so you can install directly with pip:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ pip install uamqp
        
        
        If you are running a Linux distro that does not support `ManyLinux1 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513>`__, you can install from source:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ apt-get update
            $ apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev uuid-dev cmake libcurl4-openssl-dev pkg-config python3-dev python3-pip
            $ pip3 install uamqp --no-binary
        
        
        Python 2.7 support
        ++++++++++++++++++
        Coming soon...
        
        
        Developer Setup
        ===============
        In order to run the code directly, the Cython extension will need to be build first.
        
        Pre-requisites
        ++++++++++++++
        
        - Windows: Setup a `build environment <https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-binary-extensions/#building-binary-extensions>`__.
        - Linux: Install dependencies as descriped above in the installation instructions.
        - MacOS: Install cmake using Homebrew:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ brew install cmake
        
        Building the extension
        ++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        This project has two C library dependencies. They are vendored in this repository in these versions:
        
        - `Azure uAMQP for C <https://github.com/Azure/azure-uamqp-c>`__ @ `8df0792 <https://github.com/Azure/azure-uamqp-c/releases/tag/1.2.4>`__
        - `Azure C Shared Utility <https://github.com/Azure/azure-c-shared-utility>`__ @ `1.1.4 <https://github.com/Azure/azure-c-shared-utility/releases/tag/1.1.4>`__
        
        To build, start by creating a virtual environment and installing the required Python packages:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ python -m venv env
            $ env/Scripts/activate
            (env)$ pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
        
        Next, run the build command:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ python setup.py built_ext --inplace
        
        Tests
        +++++
        
        The tests can be run from within the virtual environment. The extension must be built first using the instructions above.
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            (env)$ pytest
