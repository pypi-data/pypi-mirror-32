# Chatty

*A multi-platform chat bot framework*


## Description

Chatty is a Python 3 package designed to map any chat platform to the same
standardized interface. The goal is to allow a chat bot to be remapped 
from one platform or protocol to another, or even to multiple platforms
at the same time, with nothing more than a change to a configuration file.


## Current Development Status

Chatty is brand new, and has currently only been tested for basic message
delivery using email (imap & smtp, but not pop3 yet), xmpp, and Slack. See 
the [TODO list] for a list of other platforms that will (hopefully) 
eventually be supported.


## Contributing

If you have a need for a specific platform or protocol to be supported,
I'll be happy to accept pull requests. If you're looking to contribute 
but need a place to start, please see the [TODO list]. There are plenty of 
platforms and functionality yet to be added. Each supported platform has 
its own module in the [chatty/sessions] folder, and its dependencies 
should be added to the `extras_require` parameter in [setup.py]. Tests
go in the [test_chatty] folder and are named with `test_` prefixed to the 
name of the module being tested. 

Submitted code should adhere to [pep8 guidelines] and should, in general,
follow the conventions established elsewhere in the Chatty code base. For 
the sake of clarity, please note that by submitting a pull request, you 
agree, as per standard practice, and also the [GitHub terms of service] to 
make your code available under the [license] governing this project.


## Design

The design of Chatty is object-oriented, and centers around 3 core 
abstractions:

* **Signals**: A signal is any single indivisible element of communication,
  such as a message or a notification, which may or may not contain
  content or data of some sort. Signals always come with certain attached
  *metadata* which determines where the signal originated, who it was
  sent to, when it was sent, etc.
* **Bots**: A bot is an endpoint where inbound signals are handled, and
  outbound signals are generated.
* **Sessions**: A session is an open channel over which signals can be
  sent and/or received.

By default, signals arrive and are sent asynchronously. The 
`SynchronizedBot` wrapper can be used to ensure receipt and sending
of signals is fully synchronized from the perspective of the bot.
