        Extending [PyYAML] with a custom constructor for including [YAML] files within [YAML] files.
        
        ## Install
        
        ```sh
        pip install pyyaml-include
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Consider we have such [YAML] files:
        
            ├── 0.yaml
            └── include.d
                ├── 1.yaml
                └── 2.yaml
        
        - `1.yaml` 's content:
        
          ```yaml
          name: "1"
          ```
        
        - `2.yaml` 's content:
        
          ```yaml
          name: "2"
          ```
        
        To include `1.yaml`, `2.yaml` in `0.yaml`, we shall first add `YamlIncludeConstructor` to [PyYAML]'s loader, then write `!include` tag in `0.yaml` and load it:
        
        ```python
        import yaml
        from yamlinclude import YamlIncludeConstructor
        
        yaml.add_constructor('!include', YamlIncludeConstructor())
        
        with open('0.yaml') as f:
            data = yaml.load(f)
        
        print(data)
        ```
        
        ### Include files by name
        
        - On top level:
        
          If `0.yaml` was:
        
          ```yaml
          !include include.d/1.yaml
          ```
        
          We'll get:
        
          ```json
          {"name": "1"}
          ```
        
        - In mapping:
          
          If `0.yaml` was:
        
          ```yaml
          file1: !include include.d/1.yaml
          file2: !include include.d/2.yaml
          ```
        
          We'll get:
        
          ```json
          {
            "file1": {"name": "1"},
            "file2": {"name": "2"}
          }
          ```
        
        - In sequence:
          
          If `0.yaml` was:
        
          ```yaml
          files:
            - !include include.d/1.yaml
            - !include include.d/2.yaml
          ```
        
          We'll get:
        
          ```json
          {"files": [
            {"name": "1"},
            {"name": "2"}
          ]}
          ```
        
        > **ℹ Note**:
        > File name can be either absolute (like `/usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile`) or relative (like `../../img/banner.gif`).
        
        ### Include files by wildcards
        
        File name can contain shell-style wildcards. Data loaded from the file(s) found by wildcards will be set in a sequence.
        
        If `0.yaml` was:
        
        ```yaml
        files: !include include.d/*.yaml
        ```
        
        We'll get:
        
        ```json
        {"files": [
          {"name": "1"},
          {"name": "2"}
        ]}
        ```
        
        > **ℹ Note**:
        > - For `Python>=3.5`, if `recursive` argument of `!include` [YAML] tag is `true`, the pattern `“**”` will match any files and zero or more directories and subdirectories.
        > - Using the “**” pattern in large directory trees may consume an inordinate amount of time because of recursive search.
        
        In order to enable `recursive` arugment, we shall write the `!include` tag in `Mapping` or `Sequence` mode:
        
        - Arguments in `Sequence` mode:
        
          ```yaml
          !include [tests/data/include.d/**/*.yaml, true]
          ```
        
        - Arguments in `Mapping` mode:
        
          ```yaml
          !include {pathname: tests/data/include.d/**/*.yaml, recursive: true}
          ```
