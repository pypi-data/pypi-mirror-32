A FORTRAN implementation of the `Language Server Protocol <https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol>`_ using Python (2.7+).

Editor extensions using this language server to provide autocomplete and other IDE-like functionality are available for `Atom <https://atom.io/packages/ide-fortran>`_ and `Visual Studio Code <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hansec.fortran-ls>`_.

**Note: This language server is currently in the early stages of development.
Not all features are supported or planned.**

Installation
------------

``pip install fortran-language-server``

Language server settings
------------------------

The following global settings can be used when launching the language server.

* ``--symbol_skip_mem`` Do not include type members in document symbol results
* ``--incrmental_sync`` Use incremental document synchronization (beta)
* ``--autocomplete_no_prefix`` Do not filter autocomplete results by variable prefix

**Debug settings:**

The following settings can be used to perform `standalone debug tests <https://github.com/hansec/fortran-language-server/wiki>`_ on the language server.

* ``--debug_filepath=DEBUG_FILEPATH`` Path to file for file specific tests
* ``--debug_rootpath=DEBUG_ROOTPATH`` Root path for language server tests
* ``--debug_parser`` Test source parser on specified file instead of running language server
* ``--debug_symbols`` Test symbol generation for specified file instead of running language server

Configuration
-------------

Project specific settings can be specified by placing a JSON file named ``.fortls`` (example below)
in the ``root_dir`` directory.

**Setup module search paths:**

By default all files with the suffix ``F,F77,F90,F95,F03,F08,FOR,FPP`` (case-insensitive) in the
``root_dir`` directory, specified during initialization, and all its sub-directories are parsed and included in
the project.

Directories and files can be excluded from the project by specifying their paths (relative to ``root_dir``) in
the ``excl_paths`` variable in the ``.fortls`` file. Excluded directories also exclude all sub-directories.

Module directories can also be specified manually by specifying their paths (relative to ``root_dir``) in
the ``mod_dirs`` variable in the ``.fortls`` file. When ``mod_dirs`` is specified directories are not added
recursively, so any nested sub directories must be explicitly listed. However, ``root_dir`` does not need to
be specified manually as it is always included.


::

    {
      "mod_dirs": ["subdir1", "subdir2"],
      "excl_paths": ["subdir3", "subdir1/file_to_skip.F90"]
    }
