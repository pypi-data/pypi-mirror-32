# Getting started for developers #

This file is written in "Markdown".

"Github" (or similar) is recommended when working together on a project.

*If a version management system is used, this file should provide instructions for 
others on how to use it.*
***

## Contributors ##
	
-	Init. Release (version 0.1.0), WS17/18: - .

-	Release (version X.X.X), WSXX/XX: Name, Name, Name, Name.
	
	*Students involved in further contributions shall record themselves here by 
	entering the release version, their semester and their names.*

	
### Contributor responsibility, money and license ###

No responsibility for any financial or other damage.

People contributing to the project are unpaid. 
No money is made from this application at the time of writing 
(and there are no plans for this to change).

This application is Open Source Software. The software license is MIT, for more 
informations please see the **LICENSE** file for details.	


## How do I get an overview of the project? ##

-	Read the **README** file.
-	Go through the code.
-	Read the **CHANGES** file.

If things are unclear, please ask your professor.


## What can I do right now? ##

At this point, you will be asked to bring in your ideas and suggestions for 
improving the project.

It does not have to be a world-shaking change.

The goal is to leave an attractive and teaching project to your fellow students.
And giving someone a task is fun.
  
Do not forget to log the changes you made in **CHANGES**.

Modify the **README**, **LICENSE** and **CONTRIBUTING** files as much as you have to.
Modify the content from **cx_Freeze_stuff** and the **CHEAT-SHEET** if necessary.

### Ideas #######################################################################

*Eventually, modify this list after you have finished working on the project. 
Cross out ideas you realized, like ~~this~~, or delete the ones that don't make 
sense anymore.*


These are no TODO's but suggestions:

-	Improve the "Guard", maybe make him also accept valid variations of the
	solution as the right answer.
- 	Correct the riddles. Are they too hard/easy?
-	Parts of the Code are sloppy...Adding some safeties would be reasonable 
	(Try-Block when opening an image file, f.e.) 
-	The riddle "Raccourci" is buggy. Refactor it, or instead create a new one for the 
	"Command Line" Topic.
-	The image editing was made with very poor skills. Improve them!
- 	Add a new riddle. Something more related to electrical engineering?
- 	The "GTG" is supposed to be fun and a break. Expand it!
	You could also implement the game in the application itself instead of 
	just passing the script that then runs in the command line 
	(maybe in an additional GUI frame?).
- 	Make the project system-independent
	(...to create installers for different OSs read about "cx_Freeze" and get
	familiar with it).
- 	Improve the "status message" functionality. Make "the Riddler" more communicative.
-	By now, the Riddler has no "ending". It stops with the last riddle page. 
	You could add an ending frame.

HAVE FUN!!
