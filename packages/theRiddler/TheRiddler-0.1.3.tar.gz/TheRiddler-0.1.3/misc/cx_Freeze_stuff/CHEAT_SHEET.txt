CHEAT SHEET FOR CX_FREEZE SETUP (Help for the last riddle "Enroulement")
------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALL CX_FREEZE

	cx_Freeze 6.x (6.0b1) is intended to support Python 3.5 and above.
	It is recommended to install cx_Freeze 6.0b1 by using "pip":
		"> pip install cx_Freeze==6.0b1"
		
		
CHANGES MADE ON THE PROJECT SKELETON IN ORDER TO FREEZE THE APP TO AN EXE AND/OR MSI :

- 	Exchanged the "setup.py" file.

- 	Reduced content: 
		No "misc" folder, no README file, no MANIFEST file needed.
		No test scripts.
		
-	"__main__.py" file renamed to "theriddler.py", so that after freezing it 
	will be "theriddler.exe".

-	Icon file put in the main directory, so it's besides "data", 
	"setup.py" and "theriddler.py"(see screenshot).
	This way, cx_Freeze will be able to use the icon as application symbol.
	
- 	The icon file path and the file and photo path (in the parent class "Riddle") 
	have been changed to relative ones.
	
- 	ALL the riddle scripts were copied in the main script, 
	so that there is only the single "theriddler.py" script left:
		This is a bit messy, but if they are included in the cx_Freeze package 
		like the "data" folder, the riddle scripts (and each key words within) are 
		readable as ".py" files, once it is freezed to an "exe" or "msi" package.
		
		By putting all riddles in the main script, the code will be "crypted",
		as the executed script is then transformed to an ".exe"-file.

		
Shell commands to freeze:

-	"> python setup.py build"		 (build exe)
-	"> python setup.py bdist_msi"	 (build msi installer, single-file!)
