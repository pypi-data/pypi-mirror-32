# At first, the idea was to create an encrypted ZIP file. The password then would have 
# been set to the amount of "HTWG" strings found within the website's source code. 
# Python comes with a built-in "zipfile" module, which provides tools to create, read, 
# write, append, and list a ZIP file. 
# Unfortunately, it seems that there are by now (02.2018) very few and unpleasant
# possibilities for creating encrypted(!) ZIP(or RAR) files in Python 3.X, so a 
# workaround was made by throwing a dialog window (CustomDialog) before the Download
# Button to ask for the amount.
