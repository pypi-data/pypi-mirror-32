HELLO WORLD

The author wants you to know that it's NOT cool to hand over solutions to fellow students. 
"Yeaaahr but he's my buddy u know man that's y" - Don't do it.


HOW TO:
	
	SEARCH THE MIGHTY INTERNET! 
	Python is strongly represented online, just use the programming forums to get some help.
	
	Every riddle should be solvable programmatically and by short 
	and straightforward scripts.
	Try to solve the riddles by yourself, as long you are not told otherwise.

	Present the respective solution approach to the professor by 
	handing out your prepared script.
	Regarding the submission, your professor will give you further instructions.

	Make sure that the code you submit is understandable. 
	The script should be runnable, even if it does not lead to the solution.
	
	
I hope you enjoy it, that's what it was designed for. 

Have fun!
