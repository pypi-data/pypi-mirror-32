Based on this tutorial:

Currently we are hosting our package in Git since it is quick and easy to set up.
However, that has a number of disadvantages, the most visible disadvantage being that pip install will run much slower, because it has to do a git pull every time you ask it to check that foodutils is installed (even if you specify the same commit / tag each time).
