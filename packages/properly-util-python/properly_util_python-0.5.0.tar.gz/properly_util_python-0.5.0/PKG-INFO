        Based on this tutorial:
        http://greenash.net.au/thoughts/2015/06/splitting-a-python-codebase-into-dependencies-for-fun-and-profit/
        
        Currently we are hosting our package in Git since it is quick and easy to set up.
        However, that has a number of disadvantages, the most visible disadvantage being that pip install will run much slower, because it has to do a git pull every time you ask it to check that foodutils is installed (even if you specify the same commit / tag each time).
