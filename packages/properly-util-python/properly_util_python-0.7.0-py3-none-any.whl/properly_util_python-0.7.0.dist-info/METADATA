# properly-util-python


## Quick Run

1. Setup the environment for development by calling ./setup.sh

3. Increase the `version` in [setup.py](https://github.com/GoProperly/properly-util-python/blob/master/setup.py#L8)
4. Run `./tests.sh` to run automated tests.



## Uploading the Package

NOTE: This is necessary if you are Installing using pypi, if you install using git this can be skipped

5. `source deploy.sh`

Based on this tutorial:

Currently we are hosting our package in Git since it is quick and easy to set up.
However, that has a number of disadvantages, the most visible disadvantage being that pip install will run much slower, because it has to do a git pull every time you ask it to check that foodutils is installed (even if you specify the same commit / tag each time).
