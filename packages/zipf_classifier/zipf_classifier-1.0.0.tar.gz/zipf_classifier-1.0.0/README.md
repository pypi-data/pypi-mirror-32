# Zipf classifier

## What is this?
Hello, I'm Luca Cappelletti and here I will show you a complete explanation and example of usage of [ZipfClassifier](https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/zipf_classifier), a classifier that leverages the assumption that some kind of datasets (texts, [some images](http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/bmvc2007/proceedings/CD-ROM/papers/paper-288.pdf), even [sounds in spoken languages](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033993)) follows the [Zipf law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law). A full explanation and example is available here (datasets too): [Explanation notebook](https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/zipf_classifier/blob/master/readme%20notebook%20full%20example%20and%20explanation.ipynb).
