# imgdupes

![video_capture](video_capture.gif)
Images by [Caltech 101] dataset that semi-deduped for demonstration.

`imgdupes` is a command line tool for finding and deleting duplicate and/or similar image files based on perceptual hash.  
You can delete duplicate image files with an operation similar to the [`fdupes`] command.  
It is better to pre-deduplicate identical files with [`fdupes`] in advance.


## For large dataset

It is possible to speed up dedupe process by approximate nearest neighbor search of hamming distance with [NGT].
See [Against large dataset](#Against_large_dataset) section for details.


# Install

To install, simply use pip:

```bash
$ pip install imgdupes
```


# Usage

Find a set of images with Hamming distance of phash less than 4.  
To search images recursively from the target directory, add `-r` or `--recursive` option.

```bash
$ imgdupes --recursive images phash 4
images/airplane_0583.jpg
images/airplane_0800.jpg

images/watch_0122.jpg
images/watch_0121.jpg
```

By default, imgdupes displays a list of duplicate images and exits.
To display the image preserve or delete prompt, use the `-d` or `--delete` option

If you are using iTerm 2, you can display a set of images on the terminal with the `-c` or `--imgcat` option.

```bash
$ imgdupes --recursive --delete --imgcat 101_ObjectCategories phash 4
```

The set of images are sorted in ascending order of file size and displayed together with the pixel size of the image, you choose which image to preserve.


# Against large dataset

`imgdupes` supports approximate nearest neighbor search of hamming distance with [NGT].

To dedupe images using NGT, run with `--ngt` option after installing NGT and python binding.

```bash
$ imgdupes -rdc --ngt 101_ObjectCategories phash 4
```

For instructions on installing NGT and python binding, see [NGT] and [python NGT].


# Using docker containers with imgdupes

You can use `imgdupes` using a pre-build docker container.
[NGT] and [python NGT] is already installed in this container.

Clone imgdupes repository in advance and copy target directoris into imgdupes directory.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/knjcode/imgdupes
$ cd imgdupes
$ cp -r <target_dir> .
$ docker-compose run imgdupes -rdc --ngt <target_dir> phash 4
```

When docker-compose is executed, current directory is mounted inside the container and referenced from imgdupes.


# Available hash algorithm

`imgdupes` uses the [ImageHash] to calculate perceptual hash.
You can use the same hash method as [ImageHash] library.

- [ahash]: average hashing
- [phash]: perception hashing
- [dhash]: difference hashing
- [whash]: wavelet hashing


# Options

`-r` `--recursive`

search images recursively from the target directory (default=False)

`-d` `--delete`

prompt user for files to preserve and delete (default=False)

`-c` `--imgcat`

display duplicate images for iTerm2 (default=False)

`--num-proc`

number of hash calculation and ngt processes (default=cpu_count-1)

`--ngt`

use NGT for calculating Hamming distance between hash of images (default=False)

`--ngt-k`

number of searched objects when using NGT.
Increasing this value, improves accuracy and increases computation time. (default=20)

`--ngt-epsilon`

search range when using NGT.
Increasing this value, improves accuracy and increases computation time. (default=0.1)

`--log`

output logs of duplicate and delete files (default=False)

`--cache`

create and use image hash cache (default=False)

`--size 256x256`

resize image (default=256x256)

`--space 0`

space between images (default=0)

`--space-color black`

space color between images (default=black)

`--tile-num 4`

horizontal tile number (default=4)

`--no-keep-aspect`

do not keep aspect when displaying images

`--no-subdir-warning`

stop warnings that appear when similar images are in different subdirectories

`--dry-run`

dry run (do not delete any files)
