Requirements: this module uses tlslite.utils or gdata.tlslite.utils to create
the key signature, see https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tlslite-ng or
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tlslite for download and installation

Note: to convert your .p12 or .pfx file to unencrypted PEM format, you can use
the following 'openssl' command:

openssl pkcs12 -in UserCert.p12 -out client.pem -nodes
