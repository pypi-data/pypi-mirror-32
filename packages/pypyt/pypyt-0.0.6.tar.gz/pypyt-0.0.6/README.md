# pypyt 0.0.6
It is a simple library to render PowerPoint presentations using python

# How to install it:


    pip install pypyt



# How to use it:
- You need to create a template file with the objects named as shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhES3of_9Nw).

Lets assume that you have a template file named \_\_template\_\_.pptx with two shapes: *presentation_title* and
*client_name* (as shown in the image below), in order to render it you might use the following code:

![](images/template1.png)
```python
from pypyt import render_and_save_ppt

values = {
    'presentation_title': "This is a cool presentation",
    'client_name': "Cool Client"
}

render_and_save_ppt('__template__.pptx', values, 'rendered_ppt.pptx')
```
    
This will render a presentation like the one below.
