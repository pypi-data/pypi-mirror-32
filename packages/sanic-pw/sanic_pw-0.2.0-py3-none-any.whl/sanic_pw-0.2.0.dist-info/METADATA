## Migrations
If you're using the Sanic-Script package, then append a new command to your manager:
```python
from sanic_pw import Peewee

# ...
app.db = Peewee(app)

manager = Manager(app)
manager.add_command('db', app.db.manager)
```
For a case when you're prefer to use click it almost the same:
```python
from sanic_pw import Peewee

# ...
app.db = Peewee(app)
app.db.cli() 
```
After it, you can use database `create`, `migrate` or `rollback` commands.
