    #          dates are accounted for, e.g., this function will not report
    #          1/1/2000 00:00 to 1/1/2001 00:00 as exactly 1 year.
    #        We could use library to do date match, and then all we'd
    #          need to calculate here is math for one day, or maybe the
    #          month. But don't calculate anything more than the current
    #          month's worth of days? So, would 2/10 to 3/10 be "1 month",
    #          and 3/10 to 4/10 also be "1 month"? Or should we never use
    #          months, but use weeks and years instead??? Month would work
    #          if we counted elapsed months using day of month, rather than
    #          seconds! There's gotta be a calendar math library to help us
    #          out...
    #        (Considering month math, would, e.g., 1/1/2000 to 4/1/2000
    #          be reported as exactly 3 months? But then 1/28 to 2/28
    #          would be reported as "1 month", but 2/28 to 3/28 would
    #          not be "1 month" (though it would be "4 weeks"...). No
    #          wonder I decided to name this package "pedantic"!)
