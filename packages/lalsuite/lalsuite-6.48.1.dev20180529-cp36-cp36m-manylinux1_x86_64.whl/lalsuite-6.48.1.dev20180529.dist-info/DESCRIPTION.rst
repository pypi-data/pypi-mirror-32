LALSuite is the LIGO Scientific Collaboration Algorithm Library for
gravitational-wave analysis. Its primary purpose is searching for and
characterizing astrophysical signals in gravitational-wave time series data,
particularly data from ground-based detectors such as `LIGO
<https://www.ligo.org>`_ and `Virgo <http://www.virgo-gw.eu>`_.

LALSuite consists of a set of ``configure``-``make``-``install`` style software
packages organized by problem domain or source classification. This Python
package provides a standalone, dependency-free binary distribution of the
libraries and Python modules in LALSuite for Linux and macOS.

To install, simply run::

    $ pip install lalsuite
