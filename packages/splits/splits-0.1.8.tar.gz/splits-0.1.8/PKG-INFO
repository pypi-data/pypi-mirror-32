        Splits is a library for reading and writing files in splittable chunks.
        It works on any file-like object.
        There is built in support for writing and reading split files from S3.
        It also has built in support for gzip.

        if __name__ == '__main__':
        
            with SplitWriter('s3://test-bucket/test-multifile',
                             suffix='.txt', lines_per_file=100,
                             fileClass=GzipS3File) as w:
                w.writelines([str(x) for x in range(0, 1000)])
        
            with SplitReader('s3://test-bucket/test-multifile',
                             fileClass=GzipS3File) as r:
