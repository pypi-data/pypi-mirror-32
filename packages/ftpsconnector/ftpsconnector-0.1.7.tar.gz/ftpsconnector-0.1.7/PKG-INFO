        # Installation
        ```py
        pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
        ```
        
        # Example usage:
        
        ### Bring in dependencies and set up user/pass
        ```py
        import ftplib
        from helper_functions import *
        user = 'brian'
        password = open(
            "~/Documents/GitHub/bc/zmq-telemetry/upload/password.txt").read()
        
        ftp = connect()
        ```
        You need to define a file called `password.txt` and include only one line with your password in plaintext. Do not commit this file, use a .gitignore.
        
        You can view files on the server's home folder with `ftp.retrlines('LIST home')`.
        
        ### Upload big file
        ```py
        input_filepath = "/Applications/0ad_macbook.zip"
        destination_filepath = "home/brian_scratch/0ad.zip"
        tx_with_progress(ftp, input_filepath, destination_filepath,
                         block_size_bytes=12500000)
        ```
        ### Download that file back to local
        ```py
        filepath_pensieve = "home/brian_scratch/0ad.zip"
        filepath_local = "~/Downloads/0ad.zip"
        receive(ftp, filepath_pensieve, filepath_local, 
                block_size_bytes=12500000)
        ```
        ### Close out the connection
        ```py
        ftp.quit()
        ftp = None
        ```
        
        # Devnotes
        ```
        python setup.py sdist upload -r pypitest
        python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi
        ```
        ```
