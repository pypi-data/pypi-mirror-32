Description: ### Labelprinterkit
        
        Labelprinterkit is a Python3 library for creating and printing labels. It was
        developed for the Networking department of the KIT (Karlsruhe Institute of
        Technology).
        
        Labelprinterkit's simple layout engine can use it to declaratively create
        Labels:
        
        ```python
        >>> class MyLabel(Label):
        ...     items = [
        ...         Text(), Text()
        ...     ]
        ...
        >>> l = MyLabel("text1", "text2")
        >>> printer.print_label(l)
        ```
        
        The Following printers are currently supported:
        
         * Brother P-Touch PT-700 (aka P700)
        
        The following printers will probably work, but are not tested:
        
         * Brother H500
         * Brother E500
