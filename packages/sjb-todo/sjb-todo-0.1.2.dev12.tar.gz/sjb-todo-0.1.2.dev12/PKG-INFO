Description: # sjb_todo
        A simple CRUD command line program for working with 'todo lists'

        # Installation
        This program is in pre-alpha and is not using any deployment tools so I make zero guarantees about installation.
        
        However, I have written a crude script that should more or less work provided the user has `python3.6` installed in a linux environment and has all of the required python dependencies. Since these dependencies are subject to change, and this is my first time writing a deployed python app, I have not bothered to record them or incorporate them into the install script. In the future I hope to fix this.
        
        ## Instructions
        ~~~~
        $ cd <this directory>
        $ ./install.sh
        $ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/sjb/todo
        ~~~~
        where `<this directory>` is the directory containing this README file. Also it's important that you run `./install.sh` as a regular user (dont use sudo).
        
        # Developing
        There is a script `setup_dev.sh` which sets up a virtual environment. This causes `sjb-todo` to execute the local code in `src` instead of the code installed on the system.
        
        To enter the development environment:
        ~~~
        $ cd <this directory>
        $ . setup_dev.sh
        ~~~
        where `<this directory>` is the directory containing this README file.
        
        To leave the development environment just type:
        ~~~~
        $ deactivate
        ~~~~
        
        Warning: the development environment still uses the same data files as the real environment. This will eventually be fixed.
