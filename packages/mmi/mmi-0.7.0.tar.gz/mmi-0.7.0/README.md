# Model Message Interface (mmi). Sending arrays with metadata between processes.

This document describes the Model Message Interface (MMI): a draft protocol for serializing messages between numerical models and between numerical modesl and other programs.

There is already a common protocol in use for model messages, MPI. This works great for communication within a model. Since MPI2 it can also be used to set up ad hoc communication between models.

There are scenarios where communication through MPI is not the most appropriate approach:

Inter-language communication (e.g. JavaScript and C# support for MPI is unavailable or lagging)
Flexible process structures (e.g., dynamic populations of distributed programs)
Communcating through the web (e.g., through firewalls).
Here we describe a serialization protocol that can be used as a layer on top of alternative messaging protocols such as Ã˜MQ and WebSockets.

Our main focus is sending and receiving n-dimensional arrays of simple fixed-length types such as integers and floating-point values, along with metadata and additional attributes. We base our data model on the Variables and Attributes from the Common Data Model [ref].

A message contains a block of metadata followed by the data raw, binary format.

Metadata is in JSON format and UTF8 encoded.  It contains at least the following three attributes:

``` json
{
  "name": "variable",
  "shape": [3,3],
  "dtype": "float64"
}

```

With CF extension:

An extended example:

``` json
{
  "name": "variable",
  "shape": [3,3],
  "dtype": "float64",
  "attributes": {
       "standard_name": "sea_surface_altiude",
       "units": "m"
  },
}

```

With numpy slicing convention:

``` json
{
  "name": "variable",
  "shape": [3,3],
  "dtype": "float64",
  "continuguous": "C",
  "strides": [[0,1],[0,2]]
}

```

An intersection of the Python buffer protocol and the JavaScript ArrayBuffer protocol is forseen for the bulk (binary) data transmission.
