developer-tools
===========

Useful tools for Python developers.

This is mostly an example to show how `autopip <https://pypi.org/project/autopip/>`_ can be used to install a group of
apps with various version specifications, but the author does install it as it conveniently provides all the tools
useful for doing Python software development.

To install::

    autopip install developer-tools

For security and user experience, it is recommended to pin to a specific version -- at least minor -- for apps that you
don't own. For apps that you own where you have good versioning in the app, then `latest` works better.
