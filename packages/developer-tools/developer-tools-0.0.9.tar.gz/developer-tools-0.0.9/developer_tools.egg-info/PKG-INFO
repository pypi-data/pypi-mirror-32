Description: developer-tools
        ===========
        
        Useful tools for Python developers.
        
        This is mostly an example to show how `autopip <https://pypi.org/project/autopip/>`_ can be used to install a group of
        apps with various version specifications, but the author does install it as it conveniently provides all the tools
        useful for doing Python software development.
        
        To install::
        
            autopip install developer-tools
        
        For security and user experience, it is recommended to pin to a specific version -- at least minor -- for apps that you
        don't own. For apps that you own where you have good versioning in the app, then `latest` works better.
