        ===========
        
        Useful tools for Python developers.
        
        This is mostly an example to show how `autopip <https://pypi.org/project/autopip/>`_ can be used to install a group of
        apps with various version specifications, but the author does install it as it conveniently provides all the tools
        useful for doing Python software development.
        
        To install::
        
            autopip install developer-tools
        
        How does it work? You can tell `autopip` to install other apps by setting an `autopip` entry point group in
        ``setup.py`` with the list of apps and versions. Versions can be pinned to major or a specific version, or use `latest`
        to install the latest version. Take a look at the `autopip` entry point group in
        `developer-tools' setup.py <https://github.com/maxzheng/developer-tools/blob/master/setup.py>`_
        
        For security and user experience, it is recommended to pin to a specific version -- at least minor -- for apps that you
        don't own. For apps that you own where you have good versioning in the app, then `latest` works better.
