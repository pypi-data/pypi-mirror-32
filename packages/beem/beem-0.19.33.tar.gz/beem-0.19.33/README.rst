beem - Unofficial Python Library for Steem
===============================================

Support & Documentation
=======================
You may find help in the  `beem-discord-channel`_. The discord channel can also be used to discuss things about beem.

A complete library documentation is available at  `beem.readthedocs.io`_.

Installation
============
The minimal working python version is 2.7.x. or 3.4.x

beem can be installed parallel to python-steem.

For Debian and Ubuntu, please ensure that the following packages are installed:
        
.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev python-dev

For Fedora and RHEL-derivatives, please ensure that the following packages are installed:

.. code:: bash

    sudo yum install gcc openssl-devel python-devel

For OSX, please do the following::

    brew install openssl
    export CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include $CFLAGS"
    export LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib $LDFLAGS"

For Termux on Android, please install the following packages:

.. code:: bash

    pkg install clang openssl-dev python-dev

Signing and Verify can be fasten (200 %) by installing cryptography:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -U cryptography
    
Install beem by pip::

    pip install -U beem
    
You can install beem from this repository if you want the latest
but possibly non-compiling version::

    git clone https://github.com/holgern/beem.git
    cd beem
    python setup.py build
    
    python setup.py install --user

Run tests after install::

    pytest
    
    
Installing beem with conda-forge
--------------------------------

Installing beem from the conda-forge channel can be achieved by adding conda-forge to your channels with::

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    
Once the conda-forge channel has been enabled, beem can be installed with::

    conda install beem

Signing and Verify can be fasten (200 %) by installing cryptography::

    conda install cryptography
    

CLI tool beempy
---------------
A command line tool is available. The help output shows the available commands:

    beempy --help

Stand alone version of CLI tool beempy
--------------------------------------
With the help of pyinstaller, a stand alone version of beempy was created for Windows, OSX and linux.
Each version has just to be unpacked and can be used in any terminal. The packed directories
can be found under release. Each release has a hash sum, which is created directly in the build-server
before transmitting the packed file. Please check the hash-sum after downloading.
