Directory scanner
=================

A recursive directory traverser, which can be used to traverse one or
multiple directories in parallel. It resembles the python function
os.walk(), but with the ability to walk multiple directories
simulaneously, making it suitable for comparing directory trees.

A cmd-line tool, dirscan, provides directory scanning and comparing
functions from the command-line.
