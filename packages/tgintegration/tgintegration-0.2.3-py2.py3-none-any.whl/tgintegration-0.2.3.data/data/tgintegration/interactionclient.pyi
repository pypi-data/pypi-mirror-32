        Initializes this client instance.

        Args:
            session_name:
                Name to uniquely identify a session of either a User or a Bot.
                For Users: pass a string of your choice, e.g.: "my_main_account".
                For Bots: pass your Bot API token, e.g.: "123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11"
                Note: as long as a valid User session file exists, Pyrogram won't ask you again to
                input your phone number.

            api_id:
                The *api_id* part of your Telegram API Key, as integer. E.g.: 12345
                This is an alternative way to pass it if you don't want to use the *config.ini* file.

            api_hash:
                The *api_hash* part of your Telegram API Key, as string. E.g.: "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"
                This is an alternative way to pass it if you don't want to use the *config.ini* file.

            proxy:
                Your SOCKS5 Proxy settings as dict,
                e.g.: *dict(hostname="11.22.33.44", port=1080, username="user", password="pass")*.
                *username* and *password* can be omitted if your proxy doesn't require authorization.
                This is an alternative way to setup a proxy if you don't want to use the *config.ini* file.

            test_mode:
                Enable or disable log-in to testing servers. Defaults to False.
                Only applicable for new sessions and will be ignored in case previously
                created sessions are loaded.

            phone_number:
                Pass your phone number (with your Country Code prefix included) to avoid
                entering it manually. Only applicable for new sessions.

            phone_code:
                Pass the phone code as string (for test numbers only), or pass a callback function
                which must return the correct phone code as string (e.g., "12345").
                Only applicable for new sessions.

            password:
                Pass your Two-Step Verification password (if you have one) to avoid entering it
                manually. Only applicable for new sessions.

            force_sms:
                Pass True to force Telegram sending the authorization code via SMS.
                Only applicable for new sessions.

            first_name:
                Pass a First Name to avoid entering it manually. It will be used to automatically
                create a new Telegram account in case the phone number you passed is not registered yet.
                Only applicable for new sessions.

            last_name:
                Same purpose as *first_name*; pass a Last Name to avoid entering it manually. It can
                be an empty string: "". Only applicable for new sessions.

            workers:
                Thread pool size for handling incoming updates. Defaults to 4.

            workdir:
                Define a custom working directory. The working directory is the location in your filesystem
                where Pyrogram will store your session files. Defaults to "." (current directory).
