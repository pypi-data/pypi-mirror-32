Description: # AWS MFA Helper
        Automate obtaining MFA (STS) credentials
        
        This utility will request STS credentials from AWS, then update  ~/.aws/credentials with the new credentials. STS credentials are stored in a profile suffixed with -mfa.
        
        If you have [TOTP Generator](https://github.com/jjfalling/TOTP-Generator) installed this utility will attempt to automate the TOTP code generation.
        
        You will need to update your AWS configuration (~/.aws/config) with the following settings:
        ```
        [profile my-aws-profile]
        helper_mfa_serial = (your MFA ARN)
        helper_totp_service_name = (Optional: service name in TOTP Generatior)
        ```
        
        If you need to change the STS/MFA credentials suffix in the aws config file, create ~/.aws_mfa_helper.cfg with the following:
        ```
        mfa_creds_suffix = your-new-suffix
        ```
        
        Run with the --help flag for more information.
