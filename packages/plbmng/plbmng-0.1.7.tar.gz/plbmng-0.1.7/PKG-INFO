        ``plbmng`` is tool created for usage within PlanetLab network. Main purpose of this tool is to manage your PlanetLab nodes.
                For this purpose there are tools:
                        - to gather all servers and all available information about them
                        - to create map with location of the servers
                        - to set cron job to get infromation abotu ping and ssh availability for selected servers
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
                - Python 3.6.5 (Python scripts have been tested on this version, but they would probably work also with other versions of Python.)
                - Python modules (all modules are available from pip):
                        - geocoder
                        - folium
                        - numpy
                        - vincent
                        - pandas
                - For Fedora like distros:
                        .. code-block:: bash
                         
                         $ sudo dnf install -y dialog pssh fping
        
        Instalation
        -----------
        Make sure you have installed all dependencies!
        To install the plbmng module, type:
                .. code-block:: bash
        
                 $ pip install plbmng
        
        Locate plbmng folder and run:
                .. code-block:: bash
                
                  $ ./plbmng.sh
        
        Basic usage
        -----------
        When you run plbmng for the first time, you will be prompted to add your credentials to Planetlab network. If you don't want add your credentials at the moment, you can skip it and add it in the settings option later or edit config file located in the bin folder.
        
        When you added your credentials use ``Monitor now`` option in the measure menu. It will download all servers from your slice and export it as ``default.node`` file. This step is important because other functions will not work without it.
        
        ``Main menu``
        
        ``Search nodes``: If you are looking for some specific node or set of nodes, use ``Search nodes`` option. In the next screen you can choose from three filters. search by DNS, IP or location. If you choose search by DNS or IP you will be promted to type string, which you are looking for. If you want to search by location you will be asked to choose continent and country. Then you will see all nodes from this country and you can choose one for more detailes about this node. At the bottom of the information screen you can choose from three options. 
        
        ``Measure menu``: In this menu you can set cron job for monitoring your slice. 
                        -  ``Set monitoring period``, here you can specify, how often you want to run monitoring. 
                        -  ``Set monitored elements``, supported elements are ping and SSH.
                        -  ``Monitor now`` will immediately run test, which you have chosen in the set monitored elements.
        
        ``Map menu``:
                     ``Generate map``, will create a map with all nodes from planetlab.node file. You can choose what will be displayed on map in ``Select map elements``
                     ``Select map elements``, select what do display on map. You can choose from ICMP responds and SSH time.
        ``Settings menu``:
                          In the settings menu you can change your username, password, slice name and path to private key. Another option how to change these parameters is to edit plbmng.conf file located in the bin folder.
