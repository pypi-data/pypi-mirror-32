  date: null
  version: '1.0'
  notes: >
    Cleaned up source for better PEP8 conformance
    Bumped version number to 1.0 as part of move to `semantic versioning <http://semver.org>`_,
    or at least enough of it so as to not screw up Python installation procedures
    (which don't seem to understand 0.401 is a lesser version that 0.5, because 401 > 5).
