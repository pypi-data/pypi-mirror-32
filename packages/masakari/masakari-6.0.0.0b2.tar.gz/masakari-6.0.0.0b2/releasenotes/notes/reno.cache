    features: ["Operators can now purge the soft-deleted records from the database\
        \ tables.\nAdded below command to purge the records:\n\n  ``masakari-manage\
        \ db purge --age_in_days <days> --max_rows <rows>``\n\nNOTE: ``notifications``\
        \ db records will be purged on the basis of ``update_at``\nand ``status``\
        \ fields (finished, ignored, failed) as these records will not be\nautomatically\

  releasenotes/notes/wsgi-applications-3ed7d6b89f1a5785.yaml:
    upgrade: ['WSGI application script ``masakari-wsgi`` is now available. It allows

        running the masakari APIs using a WSGI server of choice (for example

        nginx and uwsgi, apache2 with mod_proxy_uwsgi or gunicorn).

        The eventlet-based servers are still available, but the WSGI options will

        allow greater deployment flexibility.
