        A Python SDK for GiftBit's API.
        
        ## Installation
        ```bash
        $ pip install giftbit
        ```
        
        ## Getting Started 
        
        ### API Credentials
        The `GiftbitClient` needs your Giftbit credentials. You can pass them into the constructor
        or use the environment variable `GIFTBIT_API_KEY`.
        ```python
        from giftbit import GiftbitClient
        
        client = GiftbitClient(api_key="<your api key here>")
        
        # or using the environment variable
        client = GiftbitClient()
        ```
        
        By default, the `GiftbitClient` uses Giftbit's testbed API. To use the production API server, do the following: 
        ```python
        from giftbit import GiftbitClient, 
        
        client = GiftbitClient(testbed=False)
        ```
        
        You can check to see if the client is configured correctly by using the ping method
        ```python
        from giftbit import GiftbitClient, 
        
        client = GiftbitClient(testbed=False)
        
        result = client.ping()
        
        print(result)
        ```
        
        ## Brands 
        
        ### List Brands 
        
        ```python
        from giftbit import GiftbitClient, 
        
        client = GiftbitClient()
        
        result = client.list_brands()
        
        for brand in result['brands']:
            print(brand['name'])
        ```
        
        ### Get Individual Brand
        
        ```python
        from giftbit import GiftbitClient, 
        
        client = GiftbitClient()
        
        result = client.get_brand('amazonus')
        
        print(result['brand'])
        ```
