Description: Absolang
        ========
        
        A sentiment analysis library for detecting absolutist language.
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Installation::
        
            $ pip install absolang
            $ python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
        
        Determining absolutist index for text::
        
            >>> from absolang import absolutist, absolutist_index
            >>> absolutist_index("The bigger dog is running.")
            0.0
            >>> absolutist("The bigger dog is running.")
            False
            >>> absolutist_index("He was completely bowled over.")
            0.2
            >>> absolutist("He was completely bowled over.")
            True
        
        Algorithm
        ---------
        
        * Parse text into tokens using Spacy's en_core_web_sm language model.
        * Count the number of word tokens (a token is considered a word if it
          consists solely of characters from the alphabet).
        * Count the number of absolutist word tokens (a token is considered
          absolutist if its stem word is in the dictionary of absolutist words
          and it is not preceded by a negation, modifier or interjection).
        * The absolutist index is the number of absolutist words divided by the
          total number of words.
        * Text is considered absolutist if the index is greater than 1.1 percent.
        
        Caveats
        -------
        
        * The frequency of absolutist words in control texts (ones written by
          people presumed not to suffer from anxiety or depression more than
          the average person) is about 1%, so one needs a few hundred words of
          texts before results start becoming meaningful.
