Build HTML without writing a single tag.
TemPy dynamically generates HTML and accesses it in a pure Python or jQuery fashion.
Navigating the DOM and manipulating tags is also possible in a Python or jQuery-similar sintax.

No parsing and a simple structure makes TemPy fast. TemPy simply adds html tags around your data, and the actual html string exists only at render time.
