JustML client library
=====================

JustML provides automatic machine learning model selection, training and deployment in the cloud.

JustML finds the right scikit-learn or xgboost estimator for a given supervised machine learning problem, along with the optimal hyperparameters. It also selects data and feature preprocessors in order to build a complete machine learning pipeline. The selected models are fitted and deployed on JustML computing infrastructure and can be used to generate new predictions. For more information, check https://justml.io.
