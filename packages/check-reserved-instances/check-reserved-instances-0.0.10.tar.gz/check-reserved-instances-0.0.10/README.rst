Check Reserved Instances - Compare instance reservations with running
instances

Inspired by `epheph/ec2-check-reserved-instances`_, and `pull request #5
by DavidGoodwin`_

Amazon’s reserved instances are a great way to save money when using
EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, etc. An instance reservation is specified by an
availability zone, instance type, and quantity. Correlating the
reservations you currently have active with your running instances is a
manual, time-consuming, and error prone process.

This quick little Python script uses boto3 to inspect your reserved
instances and running instances to determine if you currently have any
reserved instances which are not being used. Additionally, it will give
you a list of non-reserved instances which could benefit from additional
reserved instance allocations. The report may also be sent via email.

`Regional Benefit Reserved Instances`_ are also supported!

Installation
------------

Install the package using pip:

::

    $ pip install check_reserved_instances

Configuration
-------------

A sample configuration file is provided for easy use. By default, the
script loads the configuration from config.ini in the current directory.

::

    $ cp config.ini.sample config.ini

Configuring AWS Accounts/Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multiple AWS accounts/regions are supported! Specify one or many
sections with name ``[AWS <name here>]``. These are the lists of AWS
credentials that will be used to query for instances. Replace
``<name here>`` with a nickname will be provided in the report.

The following configuration options are supported:

-  **aws\_access\_key\_id** (Optional str): The AWS IAM access key for a
   specific user.
-  **aws\_secret\_access\_key** (Optional str): The AWS IAM secret key
   for a specific user.
-  **aws\_role\_arn** (Optional str): The AWS IAM role to assume to authenticate
   with if you wish to use IAM roles to authenticate across accounts. See `AWS Documentation`_ for more information.
-  **region** (Optional str): The AWS region to query for the account.
   Defaults to us-east-1. If multiple regions are desired, another
   ``[AWS <name here>]`` section is required.
-  **rds** (Optional bool): Boolean for whether or not to check RDS
   reserved instances.
-  **elasticache** (Optional bool): Whether or not to check ElastiCache
   reserved instances.

Email Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The report can be sent via email (SMTP). Specify a section with name
``[Email]``.

The following configuration options are supported:

-  **smtp\_host** (Required str): The hostname of the SMTP server.
-  **smtp\_port** (Optional int): The port the server uses for SMTP.
   Defaults to 25.
-  **smtp\_user** (Optional str): If your SMTP server requires
   authentication, specify a username. Defaults to None (no
   authentication).
-  **smtp\_password** (Optional str): If your SMTP server requires
   authentication, specify a password. Defaults to None (no
   authentication).
-  **smtp\_recipients** (Required str): The email addresses to send the
   email alert to. Specify one or many email addresses delimited by
   comma.

   -  Example:

      -  smtp\_recipients = user1@company.com
      -  smtp\_recipients = user1@company.com, user2@company.com

-  **smtp\_sendas** (Optional str): The email address to send the emails
   as. Defaults to ``root@localhost``.
-  **smtp\_tls** (Optional bool): Whether or not the SMTP server should
   use TLS to connect. Defaults to False.

Usage
-----

The following optional parameter is supported:

- **-–config** : Specify a custom path to the configuration file.

Ideally, this script should be ran in a cronjob:

::

    # Run on the first day of every month
    0 0 1 * * check-reserved-instances --config config.ini

For one-time use, execute the script:

::

    $ check-reserved-instances --config config.ini
    ##########################################################
    ####            Reserved Instances Report            #####
    ##########################################################

    Below is the report on EC2 VPC reserved instances:
    UNUSED RESERVATION! (1) c4.large    All     Expires in [42] days.
    UNUSED RESERVATION! (1) m1.small    us-east-1b    Expires in [201] days.
    UNUSED RESERVATION! (1) m2.2xlarge  us-east-1a    Expires in [60] days.
    NOT RESERVED!  (1) t1.micro    us-east-1c    i-sxcs34na
    NOT RESERVED!  (2) m1.small    us-east-1d    i-dfgeqa53, i-456sdf4g
    NOT RESERVED!  (3) m1.medium   us-east-1d    test_instance1, i-sdf3f4d6, test_instance2
    NOT RESERVED!  (1) m2.2xlarge  us-east-1b    i-21asdf4a

    (23) running on-demand EC2 instances
    (18) EC2 reservations


    Not sending email for this report

In this example, you can easily see that an m2.2xlarge was spun up in
the wrong AZ (us-east-1b vs. us-east-1a). A c4.large regional benefit reserved instance is also unused. The
“NOT RESERVED!” section shows that you could benefit from reserving:

-  \(1) t1.micro
-  \(1) m1.small (not 2, since you’ll likely want to move your us-east-1b small to us-east-1d)
-  \(3) m1.medium

Additionally, instance IDs or Name tags are provided for unreserved
instances, and time to expiration for unused reservations are reported.

Ignoring Reservations for Running Instances
-------------------------------------------

If you wish to ignore certain running instances when performing the calculation,
you may tag these instances as follows:

::

  Key: NoReservation
  Value: True


NOTE: This feature is currently only supported for EC2 instances.

Required IAM Permissions
------------------------

The following example IAM policy is the minimum set of permissions
needed to run the reporter:

::

    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                    "ec2:DescribeReservedInstances",
                    "ec2:DescribeAccountAttributes",
                    "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
                    "rds:DescribeReservedDBInstances",
                    "elasticache:DescribeCacheClusters",
                    "elasticache:DescribeReservedCacheNodes"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
