Description: # keel
        
        keel is a program written in Python 3 and uses ncurses to display to the user a list of
        processes and their respective PIDs.
        
        The user can easily kill the highlighted process by pressing the enter key.
        
        This was spawned from a cyber defense hackathon in the University of Glasgow. My team
        had to defend our servers and we had one terminal window open to see all open connections
        and another one simply for killing. With this, we combined it into one window.
        
        The program has/will have a way to switch the processes based on which user owns them
        and will show either connections (tcp, udp, etc) as well as regular system processes.

        ## Important
        The program is not fully ready. At the moment, it is under development and not everything
        will work.
