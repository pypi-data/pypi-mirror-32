graphene-file-upload
====================

``graphene-file-upload`` is a drop in replacement for the the GraphQL
view in Graphene for Django. It supports multi-part file uploads that
adhere to the Multipart RequestÂ Spec
(https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec).

Installation:
-------------

``pip install graphene-file-upload``

Usage:
------

To use, import the view, then add to your list of urls (replace previous
GraphQL view).

.. code:: python

    from graphene_file_upload import ModifiedGraphQLView

    urlpatterns = [
      url(r'^graphql', ModifiedGraphQLView.as_view(graphiql=True)),
    ]

To add an upload type to your mutation, import and use ``Upload``.
Upload is a scalar type.

.. code:: python

    from graphene_file_upload import Upload

    class UploadMutation(graphene.Mutation):
        class Arguments:
            file = Upload(required=True)

        success = graphene.Boolean()

        def mutate(self, info, file, **kwargs):
            # file parameter is key to uploaded file in FILES from context
            uploaded_file = info.context.FILES.get(file)
            # do something with your file

            return UploadMutation(success=True)
