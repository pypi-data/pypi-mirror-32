### MathMonkey
This is a maths training system indended primarily for children. It enables parents to print existing generate new example problem and answer sheets for children. If you prefer not to pay for a commercial variety, this may be something of interest.

We want to provide:
   - good coverage of problems overall
   - good coverage of each problem
   - sensible progression path, to reasonably high-level
   - ability to re-generate problems by changing the random seed(s)
  
The intent is to generate a broad coverage of problems and answers. Please submit a PR if you would like to contribute

### Disclaimer
We are not necessarily mathemathicians, teachers or even parents. Use your own judgement to determine if these are what you want.
Algebraic monkey systems can only teach so much. Their primarly role is reinforcement of skills not explantation of principles. In short, this is designed to teach by repetition not to endavour to explain. Having said that, there is great value in being able to do something simple reliably every time.

#### Structure
This is a code-based solution. While actual questions and answers are included for you to simply print, you should be able to also generate your own problems and answers easily. Instructions on how to do that will be provided.
