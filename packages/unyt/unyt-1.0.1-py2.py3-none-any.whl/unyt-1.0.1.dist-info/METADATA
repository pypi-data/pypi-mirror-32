A package for handling numpy arrays with units


Features
--------

Often writing code that deals with data that has units can be confusing. A function might return an array but at least with plain NumPy arrays, there is no way to easily tell what the units of the data are without somehow knowing a prioi.

The ``unyt`` package provides a subclass of NumPy's ``ndarray`` class that knows about units. For example, one could do:

    >>> import unyt
    ...
    >>> cars = ['toyota', 'volkswagen', 'honda']
    >>> distance_traveled = [3.4, 5.8, 7.2] * unyt.mile
    ...
    >>> print(distance_traveled.to('km'))
    [ 5.4717696  9.3341952 11.5872768] km

And a whole lot more! See `the documentation <http://unyt.readthedocs.io>`_ for more examples as well as full API docs.
