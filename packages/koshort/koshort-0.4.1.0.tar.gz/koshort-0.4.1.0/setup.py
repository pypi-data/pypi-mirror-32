    long_description="""\
Social network services and other internet communities are open and rich data source of human spoken language.
But due to the issues of privacy and policy of each website, sharing a bunch of retrieved text data is normally prohibited.
To solve the most major Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem under this circumstances, researchers had to rely on limited public datasets and data brought by their company.
Otherwise they would implement their domain-specific crawler for each case.

Koshort is hardly inspired by the project KoNLPy, with similar philosophy. It is not about recreating another crawler but to unify efforts around so that anyone can accelerate their projects.
