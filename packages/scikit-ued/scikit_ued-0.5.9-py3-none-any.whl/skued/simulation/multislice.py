    """
    Generate real-space and frequency-space meshgrids on which to calculate
    multislice-like diffraction simulation.

    Based on the input parameters, the meshgrids' size and spacing will be adjusted
    to minimize artifacts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    crystal : Crystal instance

    resolution : 2-tuple, optional
        Desired meshgrid shape. This shape will be adjusted to minimize artifacts.
        For now, ``resolution`` must be square (e.g. ``(2048, 2048)``).
    max_k : float, optional
        Maximal simulation resolution in inverse Angstroms.
    
    Returns
    -------
    X, Y : ndarray
        Real-space meshes
    KX, KY : ndarray
        Frequency-space meshes
