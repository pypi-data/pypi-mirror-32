"""
Baseline-determination algorithms based on the wavelet tranform.

Functions
---------
baseline_dt
    Baseline determination of signals using the dual-tree complex wavelet transform. Available in 1D or along an axis. [1, 2]

baseline_dwt
    Baseline determination of signals using the discrete wavelet transform. Provided for comparison
    with the dual-tree equivalent 'baseline'. Modified algorithm from [3]. For better performance in 1D,
	use baseline_dt.
