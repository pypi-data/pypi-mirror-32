    Measure the time shift between a time trace and a reference trace
    by cross correlation.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    trace : array-like
        Time trace. Must be the same lengths as ``reference``.
    reference : array-like
        Reference trace.
    method : str {'auto', 'fft', 'direct'}, optional
        A string indicating which method to use to calculate the correlation.
    
    Returns
    -------
    shift : int or float
        Index shift between the two traces, with respect to
        the ``reference`` trace. Note that the shift can be fractional.
    
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError : if ``trace`` and ``reference`` do not have the same shape.

    --------
    time_shifts : measure time-shift between multiple traces and a reference.

    """
    Measure the time shifts between time traces and a reference by cross-correlation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    traces : iterable of ndarrays
        Time traces. These time-traces should be physically equivalent. Generators of time traces
        are also supported. All traces and ``reference`` must have the same shape.
    reference : `~numpy.ndarray` or None, optional
        If provided, the time-zero shift between the traces in ``traces`` will be measured
        with respect to ``reference``. Otherwise, the first trace in ``traces`` will be used 
        as a reference.
    method : str {'auto', 'fft', 'direct'}, optional
        A string indicating which method to use to calculate the correlation.
    
    Returns
    -------
    shifts : `~numpy.ndarray`, ndim 1, dtype float
        Time shifts as indices (possibly fractional). The length of ``shifts`` is always 
        equal to the number of time-traces; in the case where ``reference = None``, the first
        shifts will always be identically zero.
    
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError : if not all traces have the same shape.

    --------
    time_shift : measure time-shift between a single trace and a reference.
