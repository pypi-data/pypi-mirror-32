        ============================
        
        Automate chrome browser render diffs for website testing
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Featuring Puppeteer, headless Chrome and Python image diffing
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install visualdiff
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Create your tests calling ``visualdiff.compare(url)``, this will drive a
        headless Chrome session rendering the desired URL and comparing the
        resulting image with an expected one.
        
        The expectation are stored by default in a ``visualdiff`` subfolder of
        the current calling test script.
        
        There are several additional options you can use, we'll see them in the
        examples
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import visualdiff as vd
        
            assert not vd.difference('https://example.com')
