Description: # Farmware Tools
        Tools for use by [Farmware](https://developer.farm.bot/docs/farmware). Starting with FarmBot OS v6.4.2, this package is installed automatically and available for Farmware to import. See the sections below for other installation configurations.
        
        ## Example
        ```Python
        from farmware_tools import device
        device.log('hello')
        ```
        If the above code is run within a Farmware,
        [FarmBot OS](https://github.com/FarmBot/farmbot_os)
        will send a `hello` log to the
        [FarmBot Web App](https://my.farm.bot/).
        
        If the above code is run elsewhere,
        the output will be the command that would have been sent to FarmBot OS:
        ```
        {'kind': 'send_message', 'args': {'message': 'hello', 'message_type': 'info'}}
        ```
        
        ## Local installation (for local Farmware development)
        ```
        pip install farmware-tools
        ```
        
        ## Specifying a version in a Farmware manifest
        ```
        "farmware_tools_version": "v0.2.2"
        ```
        By including this line in a Farmware
        [manifest](https://developer.farm.bot/docs/farmware#section-farmware-manifest),
        FarmBot OS will automatically install the specified version
        and make it available to import from within the Farmware.
