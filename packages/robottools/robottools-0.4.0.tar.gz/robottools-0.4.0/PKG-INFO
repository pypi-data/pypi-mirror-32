        ## unname
        Sets the name of a named (-N or --name) or renamed (prerunmodifier rename:) suite back to
        it's original name as if it was set as default without either input.
        
        This isn't aware of the original longname as virtual suites may have been added. To handle
        those cases use rename and resetname.
        
        ## rename
        Rename a suite and save the original name as 'originallongname' metadata.
        
        ## resetname
        Reapply the 'originallongname' metadata and set as the suite name.
        
        ## rerunrenamedtests
        Runs resetname and then gathers failed tests to be run.
        
        ## rerunrenamedsuties
        Runs resetname and then gathers failed suites to be run.
