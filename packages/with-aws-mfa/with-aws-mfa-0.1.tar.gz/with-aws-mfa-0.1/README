with-aws-mfa: Run command with temporary credentials
=================================================================================================

**with-aws-mfa** obtains temporary AWS credentials that use Multi-Factor Authentication.  The reason to use temporary credentials is to not force a command line user to use Multi-Factor Authentication and not to have long live credentials live on the system.

If you haven't yet enabled multi-factor authentication for AWS API access, check out the [AWS article](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_configure-api-require.html) on doing so.


Installation:
-------------
Option 1

2. $ python setup.py install
```
