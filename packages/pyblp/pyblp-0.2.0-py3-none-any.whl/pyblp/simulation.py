class Simulation(object):
    r"""Simulation of synthetic BLP data.

    All data are simulated during initialization, except for Bertrand-Nash prices and shares, which are computed by
    :meth:`Simulation.solve`.

    Non-constant exogenous product characteristics in :math:`X_1`, :math:`X_2`, and :math:`X_3`, collectively denoted
    :math:`X`, along with any demographics, :math:`d`, are all drawn from the standard uniform distribution.

    Unobserved demand- and supply-side product characteristics, :math:`\xi` and :math:`\omega`, are drawn from a
    mean-zero bivariate normal distribution.

    After simulating exogenous product characteristics and constructing agent data according to an integration
    configuration, canonical instruments are computed. Specifically,

    .. math:: Z_D = [1, X, \mathrm{BLP}(X_D)] \quad\text{and}\quad Z_S = [1, X, \mathrm{BLP}(X_S)],

    in which :math:`X` are all non-constant exogenous product characteristics, :math:`\mathrm{BLP}(X_D)` are traditional
    BLP instruments constructed by :func:`build_blp_instruments` from all non-constant exogenous characteristics in
    :math:`X_1` and :math:`X_2`, and :math:`\mathrm{BLP}(X_S)` are constructed from all non-constant characteristics in
    :math:`X_3`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    basic_product_data : `structured array-like`
        Each row corresponds to a product. Markets can have differing numbers of products. The convenience function
        :func:`build_id_data` can be used to construct ID data from market, product, and firm counts. Fields:

            - **market_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate products with markets.

            - **firm_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate products with firms. Any columns after the first can be
              used in :meth:`Simulation.solve` to compute Bertrand-Nash prices and shares after changes, such as
              mergers. If there are multiple columns, this field can either be a matrix or it can be broken up into
              multiple one-dimensional fields with column index suffixes that start at zero. For example, if there are
              two columns, this field can be replaced with two one-dimensional fields: `firm_ids0` and `firm_ids1`.

            - **ownership** : (`numeric, optional') - Custom stacked :math:`J_t \times J_t` ownership matrices,
              :math:`O`, for each market :math:`t`, which can be built with :func:`build_ownership`. Each stack is
              associated with a `firm_ids` column and must have as many columns as there are products in the market with
              the most products. If a market has fewer products than others, extra columns will be ignored and may be
              filled with any value, such as ``numpy.nan``. If an ownership matrix stack is unspecified, its
              corresponding column in `firm_ids` is used by :func:`build_ownership` to build a stack of standard
              ownership matrices.

    integration : `Integration`
        :class:`Integration` configuration for how to build nodes and weights for integration over agent utilities.
    gamma : `array-like`
        Configuration for values of supply-side linear parameters, :math:`\gamma`, and for which product characteristics
        are in :math:`X_3`. The first element of this vector corresponds to a constant column; if it is zero,
        :math:`X_3` will not have a constant column. The number of following elements determines the number of columns
        in the matrix of non-constant exogenous characteristics, :math:`X`.

        If an element is zero, its corresponding characteristic will not be in :math:`X_3`. Nonzeros constitute
        :math:`\gamma`.

    beta : `array-like`
        Configuration for values of demand-side linear parameters, :math:`\beta`, and for which product characteristics
        are in :math:`X_1`. This vector must have one more element than `gamma` because the first element, which if
        specified is usually negative, corresponds to prices. Following elements correspond to the same characteristics
        as do the elements of `gamma` (a constant column and columns in :math:`X`), but shifted over by one.

        If an element is zero, its corresponding characteristic will not be in :math:`X_1`. Nonzeros constitute
        :math:`\beta`.

    sigma : `array-like`
        Configuration for values of the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix that measures agents' random
        taste distribution, :math:`\Sigma`, and for which product characteristics are in :math:`X_2`. This square matrix
        should have as many rows and columns as there are elements in `beta`, and the lower triangle must be all zeros.
        Rows and columns correspond to the same characteristics as do the elements of `beta` (prices, a constant column,
        and columns in :math:`X`).

        If a diagonal element is zero, its corresponding characteristic will not be in :math:`X_2`, unless `pi` is
        specified and has a nonzero on the row corresponding to the diagonal element. Rows and columns associated with
        other elements constitute :math:`\Sigma`.

    pi : `array-like, optional`
        Configuration for values of parameters that measures how agent tastes vary with demographics, :math:`\Pi`, and
        for the number of demographics, :math:`d`. This matrix must have as many rows as `sigma`, since they correspond
        to the same characteristics as do the rows of `sigma` (prices, a constant column, and columns in :math:`X`).

        The number of columns with at least one nonzero determines the number of demographic columns in :math:`d`, and
        these columns along with rows that constitute :math:`\Sigma` also constitute :math:`\Pi`.

    xi_variance : `float, optional`
        Variance of the unobserved demand-side product characteristics, :math:`\xi`. The default value is ``1.0``.
    omega_variance : `float, optional`
        Variance of the unobserved supply-side product characteristics, :math:`\omega`. The default value is ``1.0``.
    correlation : `float, optional`
        Correlation between :math:`\xi` and :math:`\omega`. The default value is ``0.9``.
    linear_costs : `bool, optional`
        Whether to compute marginal costs, :math:`c`, according to a linear or a log-linear marginal cost specification.
        By default, a linear specification is used. That is, :math:`\tilde{c} = c` instead of
        :math:`\tilde{c} = \log c`.
    seed : `int, optional`
        Passed to :func:`numpy.random.seed` to seed the random number generator before data are simulated.

        r"""Compute Bertrand-Nash prices and shares.

        Prices and shares are computed by iterating in each market over the :math:`\zeta`-markup equation from
        :ref:`Morrow and Skerlos (2011) <ms11>`,

        .. math:: p \leftarrow c + \zeta(p).

        Parameters
        ----------
        firms_index : `int, optional`
            Index of the column in the `firm_ids` field of `basic_product_data` in :class:`Simulation` initialization
            that defines which firms produce which products. If an `ownership` field was specified, the corresponding
            stack of ownership matrices will be used. By default, unchanged firm IDs are used.
        prices : `array-like, optional`
            Prices at which the fixed point iteration routine will start. By default, marginal costs, :math:`c`, are
            used as starting values.
        iteration : `Iteration, optional`
            :class:`Iteration` configuration for how to solve the fixed point problem. By default,
            ``Iteration('simple', {'tol': 1e-12})`` is used.
        error_behavior : `str, optional`
            How to handle errors when computing prices and shares. For example, the fixed point routine may not converge
            if the effects of nonlinear parameters on price overwhelm the linear parameter on price, which should be
            sufficiently negative. The following behaviors are supported:

                - ``'raise'`` (default) - Raises an exception.

                - ``'warn'`` - Uses the last computed prices and shares. If the fixed point routine fails to converge,
                  these are the last prices and shares computed by the routine. If there are other issues, these are the
                  starting prices and their associated shares.

        processes : `int, optional`
            Number of Python processes that will be used during computation. By default, multiprocessing will not be
            used. For values greater than one, a pool of that many Python processes will be created. Market-by-market
            computation of prices and shares and its Jacobian will be distributed among these processes. Using
            multiprocessing will only improve computation speed if gains from parallelization outweigh overhead from
            creating the process pool.

        Returns
        -------
        `recarray`
            Simulated :attr:`Simulation.product_data` that are updated with Bertrand-Nash prices and shares, which can
            be passed to the `product_data` argument of :class:`Problem` initialization.
