        Documentation
        -------------
        
        See the `wiki
        pages <https://github.com/chdemko/pandoc-codeblock-include/wiki>`__.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To apply the filter, use the following option with pandoc:
        
        ::
        
           --filter pandoc-codeblock-include
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        *pandoc-codeblock-include* requires `python <https://www.python.org>`__,
        a programming language that comes pre-installed on linux and Mac OS X,
        and which is easily installed `on
        Windows <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows>`__. Either python 2.7
        or 3.x will do.
        
        Install *pandoc-codeblock-include* as root using the bash command
        
        ::
        
           pip install pandoc-codeblock-include
        
        To upgrade to the most recent release, use
        
        ::
        
           pip install --upgrade pandoc-codeblock-include
        
        ``pip`` is a script that downloads and installs modules from the Python
        Package Index, `PyPI <https://pypi.org>`__. It should come installed
        with your python distribution. If you are running linux, ``pip`` may be
        bundled separately. On a Debian-based system (including Ubuntu), you can
        install it as root using
        
        ::
        
           apt-get update
           apt-get install python-pip
