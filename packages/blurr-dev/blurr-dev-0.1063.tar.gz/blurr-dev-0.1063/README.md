# What is Blurr?

Blurr transforms structured, streaming `raw data` into `features` for model training and prediction using a `high-level expressive YAML-based language` called the Data Transform Configuration (DTC).

The DTC is a __data transform definition__ for structured data. The DTC encapsulates the *business logic* of data transforms and Blurr orchestrates the *execution* of data transforms. Blurr is runner-agnostic, so DTCs can be run by event processors such as Spark, Spark Streaming or Flink.

This looks like any other ETL pipeline. At this point, Blurr doesn't do anything special that you cannot do with Spark, for instance. Blurr shines when an offline model pipeline needs to be turned into an online scoring pipeline.

# Is Blurr for you?

Blurr is for you if:

1. You are well on your way on the ML 'curve of enlightenment', and are thinking about how to do online scoring

![Curve](docs/images/curve.png)

2. You self-identify as a data scientist, a data engineer, or an ML engineer. But you believe that these distinctions are temporary. With the right tools, these are all one person. `data science`, `operations`, and `engineering` working together with minimal dependencies is critical to success of production ML efforts.    

# Blurr is MLOps

Blurr is a collection of components built for MLOps, the Blurr Core library is one of them. **Blurr Core âŠ† Blurr**

>We believe in a world where everyone is a data engineer. Or a data scientist. Or an ML engineer. The lines are blurred (*cough*). Just like development and operations became DevOps over time

We see a future where MLOps means teams putting together various technologies to suit their needs. For production ML applications, the __speed of experimentation__ and __iterations__ is the difference between success and failure. The __DTC helps teams iterate on features faster__. The vision for Blurr is to build MLOps components to help ML teams experiment at high speed.

# Tutorial and Docs

>Coming up with features is difficult, time-consuming, requires expert knowledge. 'Applied machine learning' is basically feature engineering --- Andrew Ng

Preparing data for specific use cases using Blurr:

# Try Blurr

One way to interact with Blurr is by using a Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI is used to run blurr
locally and is a great way of validating and testing the DTCs before deploying them in 
production. 

`$ pip install blurr`

Transform data

```
$ blurr transform \
     --streaming-dtc ./dtcs/sessionize-dtc.yml \
     --window-dtc ./dtcs/windowing-dtc.yml \
     --source file://path
```

# Data Science 'Joel Test'

Inspired by the (old school) [Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) to rate software teams, here's our version for data science teams. What's your score?

1. Data pipelines are versioned and reproducible
2. Pipelines (re)build in one step
3. Deploying to production needs minimal engineering help
4. Successful ML is a long game. You play it like it is
5. Kaizen. Experimentation and iterations are a way of life
