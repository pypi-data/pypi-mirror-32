Shady 
=====

Welcome to Shady.  Shady is for programmers who work in neuroscience,
especially vision science. It is a Python framework for presenting
psychophysically-accurate visual stimuli and manipulating them in real time.

We're currently in the middle of rolling out the software, so the documentation
is under construction. More will follow soon.

	To download and install the Python package:
		The primary and recommended method is to use the *pip* package manager.
		You should already have this, if your Python version is reasonably
		up-to-date (Python 2 versions 2.7.9 and up, or Python 3 versions 3.4 and up).
		If not, see the `pip installation instructions <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_.
		Assuming you have pip, this command will install Shady::
		
			python -m pip install shady
		
		This will automatically download the latest distribution
		from its home at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/shady , and install it.
	
	To access the full source code repository:
		Source code and build files for the Python module, the dynamic library,
		and the documentation are all managed in a `Mercurial <https://www.mercurial-scm.org/>`_
		repository, which currently resides at https://bitbucket.org/jezhill/shading
		(although this URL may change soon).  Here's how you would use Mercurial from the
		command-line to obtain it::
		
			hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jezhill/shading
	
	To ask questions:
		For most questions and support issues, use the
		`shady-project Google group <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/shady-project>`_.

		If an issue is confirmed to be a technical problem or bug, you can submit details at
		http://bitbucket.org/jezhill/shading/issues
