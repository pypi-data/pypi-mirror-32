Description: # Shinkendo
        
        This is a CLI program that can be used to interact with Shinken via Shinken WebUI.
        
        As this is a WIP, many functions are still missing.
        
        Please be aware that this program interacts with Shinken *via the Webui*. So you need a working WebUI v2.7 or more.
