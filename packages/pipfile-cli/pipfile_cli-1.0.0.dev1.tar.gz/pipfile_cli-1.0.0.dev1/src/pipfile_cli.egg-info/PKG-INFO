        Pipfile-Cli: Command line interface around Pipfile operations
        =============================================================
        
        Pipfile-Cli is a command line interface around the Pipfile API. It allows you
        to interact with a Pipfile without Pipenv.
        
        Currently it only has one functionality: ``pipfile install``. It installs the
        content of specified lockfile into the *current environment* (i.e. using the
        current pip installation, without creating a virtualenv). It is essentially
        ``pipenv install --system --deploy`` without all the checks, crafted for those
        who already know what they are doing, and want a tool to do exact that.

        ====
        
        * Optional check (enabled by default) to make sure the lockfile is up-to-date.
          This would require a way to specify both Pipfile and the lockfile. We will
          probably need to rethink the user interface for that.
