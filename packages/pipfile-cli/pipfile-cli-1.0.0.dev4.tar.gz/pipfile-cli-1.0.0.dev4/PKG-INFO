        Pipfile-CLI: Command line interface around Pipfile operations
        =============================================================
        
        Pipfile-CLI is a command line interface around the Pipfile API. It allows you
        to interact with a Pipfile without Pipenv.
        
        The command line interfaceâ€™s design is based on the three transformation
        functions, as described by Sam Boyer in his
        `So you want to write a package manager`_ piece:
        
        .. _`So you want to write a package manager`: https://medium.com/@sdboyer/so-you-want-to-write-a-package-manager-4ae9c17d9527
        
        * The user edits Pipfile to add and/or remove packages.
        * ``lock`` resolves the abstract dependency set specified in Pipfile, and write
          the resulting concrete dependency set into Pipfile.lock.
        * ``sync`` installs the concrete dependency set specified by Pipfile.lock into
          the current environment (with pip).
        
        Only ``sync`` is implemented at the present time.
