Description: # django-debug-toolbar-requests
        
        A Django Debug Toolbar panel for most popular http library [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/).
        
        # About
        
        This is a panel for [Django Debug Toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) that displays [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) http queries, data headers and stack trace.
        
        ### Installation
        
        Install django-debug-toolbar-requests
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install django-debug-toolbar-requests
        ```
        
        Add library into your django `settings.py`
        
        ```python
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
           ...
           'requests_toolbar',
           ...
        )
        ```
        
        Add panel into `DEBUG_TOOLBAR_PANELS`
        
        ```python
        DEBUG_TOOLBAR_PANELS = (
           ...
           'requests_toolbar.panels.RequestsDebugPanel',
           ...
        )
        ```
        
        
        ## Example
        
        Now always if you're will use [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) then you will see debug information in your [Django Debug Toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
        
        
        ```python
        requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get', headers={'X-headers': 'value of x header'})
        ```
