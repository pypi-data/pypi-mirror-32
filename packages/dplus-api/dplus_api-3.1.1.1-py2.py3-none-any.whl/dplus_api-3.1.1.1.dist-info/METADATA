#The Dplus Python API


The D+ Python API allows using the D+ backend from Python, instead of the ordinary D+ application.

The Python API works on both Windows and Linux.

##Installation

Installing the Python API is done using PIP:

    pip install dplus-api

The API was tested with Python 3.5 and newer. It *may* work with older versions of Python, although Python 2 
is probably not supported.

##Overview

 Please note: 

Throughout the manual, code examples are given with filenames, such as "mystate.state".
In order to run the example code for yourself, these files must be located in the same directory as the script itself,
 or alternately the code can be modified to the contain the full path of the file's location.

Throughout the manual, we mention "state files".

A state file is a JSON-format file that describes the parameter tree and calculation settings of the D+ calculation.
It isn't necessary to write one yourself-
they can either be generated from within the python interface (with the function `export_all_parameters`),
or created from the D+ GUI (by selecting File>Export All Parameters from within the D+ GUI).

The overall flow of the Python API is as follows:

1. The data to be used for the calculation is built by the user in an instance of the `CalculationInput` class 
(either `GenerateInput` or `FitInput`). Inputs contain a program `State`, which includes both program preferences 
such as `DomainPreferences`, and a parameter tree composed of `Models`.

2. This calculation input is then passed to a `CalculationRunner` class (either `LocalRunner` or `WebRunner`),
and the calculation function is called (`generate`, `generate_async`, `fit`, or `fit_async`)

3. The `CalculationRunner` class returns a `CalculationResult` class.

Here is a very simple example of what this might look line:

```
from dplus.CalculationInput import GenerateInput
from dplus.CalculationRunner import LocalRunner

calc_data = GenerateInput.load_from_state_file("mystate.state")
runner = LocalRunner()
result = runner.generate(calc_data)
print(result.graph)
```

A detailed explanation of the class types and their usage follows


##CalculationRunner

There are two kinds of CalculationRunners, Local and Web.

The LocalRunner is intended for users who have the D+ executable files installed on their system. It takes two optional
initialization arguments:

* `exe_directory` is the folder location of the D+ executables. By default, its value is None- on Windows, this will 
lead to the python interface searching the registry for an installed D+ on its own, but on linux the executable 
directory *must* be specified. 
* `session_directory` is the folder where the arguments for the calculation are stored, as well as the output results,
amplitude files, and pdb files, from the c++ executable. By default, its value is None, and an automatically generated 
temporary folder will be used. 

```
from dplus.CalculationRunner import LocalRunner

exe_dir = r"C:\Program Files\D+\bin"
sess_dir = r"sessions"
runner = LocalRunner(exe_dir, sess_dir)
#also possible:
#runner = LocalRunner()
#runner = LocalRunner(exe_dir)
#runner = LocalRunner(session_directory=sess_dir)
```

The WebRunner is intended for users accessing the D+ server. It takes two required initialization arguments, with no
default values:

* `url` is the address of the server.
* `token` is the authentication token granting access to the server. 

```
from dplus.CalculationRunner import WebRunner

url = r'http://localhost:8000/'
token = '4bb25edc45acd905775443f44eae'
runner = WebRunner(url, token)
```

Both runner classes have the same four methods: 

generate(calc_data), generate_async(calc_data), fit(calc_data), fit_async(calc_data)

All four methods take the same single argument, `calc_data` - an instance of a CalculationData class

generate and fit return a `CalculationResult`

generate_async and fit_async return a `RunningJob`

The methods generate and fit both wait until dplus has returned a result. Their asynchronous counterparts allow dplus 
calculations to be run in the background.

####RunningJob

The user should not be initializing this class. When returned from an async function in CalculationRunner, the user can 
use the following methods to interact with the RunningJob:

* `get_status()`: get a json dictionary reporting the job's current status
* `get_result(calc_data)`: get a `CalculationResult`. Requires a copy of the CalculationInput used to create the job. 
should only be called when job is completed. It is the user's responsibility to verify job completion with get_status 
before calling. 
* `abort()`: end a currently running job

```
from dplus.CalculationInput import GenerateInput
from dplus.CalculationRunner import LocalRunner

 calc_data = GenerateInput.load_from_state_file("mystate.state")
 runner = LocalRunner()
 job = runner.generate_async(calc_data)
 start_time = datetime.datetime.now()
 status = job.get_status()
 while status['isRunning']:
     status = job.get_status()
     run_time = datetime.datetime.now() - start_time
     if run_time > datetime.timedelta(seconds=50):
         job.abort()
         raise TimeoutError("Job took too long")
 result = job.get_result(calc_data)
```

##CalculationInput

There are two kinds of CalculationInput, FitInput and GenerateInput.

GenerateInput contains an instance of a `State` class and an x vector. It is used to generate the signal of a given
parameter tree (within the `State`).

FitInput contains a `State` class, an x vector, and a y vector representing a signal to be fitted. 
It is used to fit a parameter tree (within the `State`) to the signal.

The `State` class is described in the next section.

The x and y vectors are simply lists of floating point coordinates. They can be generated from parameters in the state 
class or loaded from a file.
CalculationInput has the following methods:

* `get_model`: get a model by either its `name` or its `model_ptr`
* `get_models_by_type`: returns a list of `Models` with a given `type_name`, e.g. UniformHollowCylinder
* `get_mutable_params`: returns a list of `Parameters` in the state class, whose property `mutable` is True
* `get_mutable_parameter_values`: returns a list of floats, matching the values of the mutable parameters
* `set_mutable_parameter_values`: given a list of floats, sets the mutable parameters of the state (in the order given by 
get_mutable_parameter_values)
* `export_all_parameters`: given a filename, will save the calculation state to that file

In addition, all CalculationInputs have the property `use_gpu`, which can be set to True or False (running fitting with
use_gpu set to False is not recommended).

A new instance of GenerateInput can be created simply by calling its constructor with a state:

```
from dplus.CalculationInput import GenerateInput
s=State()
gen_input=GenerateInput(s)
```

In addition, GenerateInput has the following static methods to create an instance of GenerateInput:

* `load_from_state_file(filename)` receives the location of a file that contains a serialized parameter tree (state)
* `load_from_PDB` receives the location of a PDB file, and automatically creates a guess at the best state parameters
 based on the pdb 

```
from dplus.CalculationInput import GenerateInput
gen_input=GenerateInput.load_from_state_file('sphere.state')
```

A new instance of StateInput can be created by calling its constructor, and either:

 1. `x`, `y`: two arrays, an x array and a y array, or
 2. `graph`: a single dictionary, with x values as keys for the y values

```
from dplus.CalculationInput import FitInput, load_x_and_y_from_file

x,y=load_x_and_y_from_file("signal_file.out")
state=State()
fit_input=FitInput(state, x=x, y=y)
```

FitInput also has the following static method to create an instance of FitInput:

* `load_from_state_file(filename)` receives the location of a file that contains a serialized parameter tree (state)

```
from dplus.CalculationInput import FitInput
fit_input=FitInput.load_from_state_file('sphere.state')
``` 



###State

The state class contains an instance of each of three classes: DomainPreferences, FittingPreferences, and Domain. 
They are described in the upcoming sections.

It has the methods  `get_model`, `get_models_by_type`, `get_mutable_params`,  `get_mutable_parameter_values`, and
`set_mutable_parameter_values`, `export_all_parameters`, just as CalculationInput does.

(In fact, CalculationInput simply invokes these functions from within its State when they are called from CalculationInput)

State, _and every class and sub class contained within state_ (ie preferences, models, parameters), all have the functions 
`load_from_dictionary` and `serialize`.

`load_from_dictionary` sets the values of the various fields within a class to match those contained within a suitable dictionary. 
It can behave recursively as necessary, for example with a model that has children.

`serialize` saves the contents of a class to a dictionary. Note that there may be additional fields in the dictionary
beyond those described in this document, because some defunct (outdated, irrelevant, or not-yet-implemented) fields are 
still saved in the serialized dictionary.


####DomainPreferences
The DomainPreferences class contains properties that are copied from the D+ interface. Their usage is explained in 
the D+ documentation.

We create a new instance of DomainPreferences by calling the python initialization function:

`dom_pref= DomainPreferences()`

There are no arguments given to the initialization function, and all the properties are set to default values:

|Property Name | Default Value | Allowed values|
|---|---|---|
|signal_file|	""|"", or a valid file location|
|convergence|	0.001||
|grid_size|	100|Even integer greater than 20|
|orientation_iterations|	100||
|orientation_method|	"Monte Carlo (Mersenne Twister)"|"Monte Carlo (Mersenne Twister)", "Adaptive (VEGAS) Monte Carlo", "Adaptive Gauss Kronrod"|
|use_grid|	False|True, False|
|q_max|	7.5|Positive number. If signal file is provided, must match highest x value|

Any property can then be changed easily.

`dom_pref.q_max= 10`

If the user tries to set a property to an invalid value (for example, setting q_max to something other than a positive number) they will get an error.

If a signal file is provided, the value of q_max will automatically be set to the highest x value in the signal file.


####Fitting Preferences
The FittingPreferences class contains properties that are copied from the D+ interface. Their usage is explained in the D+ documentation.

We create a new instance of FittingPreferences by calling the python initialization function:

`fit_pref= FittingPreferences()`

There are no arguments given to the initialization function, and all the properties are set to default values:

|Property Name | Default Value |Allowed Values|Required when|
|---|---|---|---|
|convergence|	0.1| Positive numbers||
|der_eps|	0.1| Positive numbers||
|fitting_iterations|	20|Positive integers||
|step_size|0.01| Positive numbers||
|loss_function|"Trivial Loss"| "Trivial Loss","Huber Loss","Soft L One Loss","Cauchy Loss","Arctan Loss","Tolerant Loss"||
|loss_func_param_one|0.5|Number|Required for all loss_function except "Trivial Loss"|
|loss_func_param_two|0.5|Number|Required when loss_function is "Tolerant Loss"|
|x_ray_residuals_type|"Normal Residuals"|"Normal Residuals","Ratio Residuals","Log Residuals"||
|minimizer_type|"Trust Region"|"Line Search","Trust Region"||
|trust_region_strategy_type|"Dogleg"|"Levenberg-Marquardt","Dogleg"|minimizer_type is "Trust Region"|
|dogleg_type|"Traditional Dogleg"|"Traditional Dogleg","Subspace Dogleg"|trust_region_strategy_type is "Dogleg"|
|line_search_type|"Armijo"|"Armijo","Wolfe"|minimizer_type is "Line Search"|
|line_search_direction_type|"Steepest Descent"|"Steepest Descent","Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient","L-BFGS","BFGS"|minimizer_type is "Line Search". if line_search_type is "Armijo", cannot be "BFGS" or "L-BFGS". |
|nonlinear_conjugate_gradient_type|""|"Fletcher Reeves","Polak Ribirere","Hestenes Stiefel"|linear_search_direction_type is "Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient"|

Any property can then be changed easily.

`fit_pref.convergence= 0.5`

If the user tries to set a property to an invalid value they will get an error.


####Domain

The Domain class describes the parameter tree. 

The root of the tree is the `Domain` class. This contains an array of `Population` classes. 
Each `Population` can contain a number of `Model` classes. Some models have children, also models.

#####Models

Domain and Population are two special kinds of models.

The Domain model is the root of the parameter tree, which can contain multiple populations. 
Populations can contain standard types of models.

The available standard model classes are:

* UniformHollowCylinder
* Sphere
* SymmetricLayeredSlabs
* AsymmetricLayeredSlabs
* Helix
* DiscreteHelix
* SpacefillingSymmetry
* ManualSymmetry
* PDB- a pdb file
* AMP- an amplitude grid file

You can create any model by calling its initialization. 

Please note that models are dynamically loaded from those available in DPlus. 
Therefore, your code editor may underline the model in red even if the model exists.

All models have Location Parameters and Extra Parameters. Some models (that support layers) also contain Layer Parameters.
These are all collection of instances of the `Parameter` class, and can be accessed from 
`model.location_params`, `model.extra_params`, and `model.layer_params`, respectively.

All of these can be modified. They are accessed using dictionaries.
Example:

```
from dplus.DataModels.models import UniformHollowCylinder

uhc=UniformHollowCylinder()
uhc.layer_params[1]["Radius"].value=2.0
uhc.extra_params["Height"].value=3.0
uhc.location_params["x"].value=2
```

For additional information about which models have layers and what the various parameters available for each model are,
please consult the DPlus manual.

######Parameters

The Parameter class contains the following properties:

value: a float whose default value is 0

sigma: a float whose default value is 0

mutable: a boolean whose default value is False

constraints: an instance of the Constraints class, by default it is the default Constraints

`p=Parameter(4)`

######Constraints

The Constraints class contains the following properties:

MaxValue: a float whose default value is infinity

MinValue: a float whose default value is -infinity

`c=Constraints(min_val=5)`

##CalculationResult

The CalculationResult class is returned by the CalculationRunner. 
The user should generally not be instantiating the class themselves. 

The class has the following properties accessible:

* 'graph': an OrderedDict whose keys are x values and whose values are y values.
* 'y': The raw list of y values from the results json
* 'headers': an OrderDict of headers, whose keys are ModelPtrs and whose values are the header associated. 
This property is not necessarily present in fitting results
* 'parameter_tree': A json of parameters (can be used to create a new state with state's load_from_dictionary). 
Only present in fitting, not generate, results
* 'error' : returns the json error report from the dplus run

In addition, CalculationResults has the following public functions:

* 'get_amp(model_ptr, destination_folder)': returns the file location of the amplitude file for given model_ptr. 
destination_folder has a default value of None, but if provided, the amplitude file will be copied to that location,
and then have its address returned 
* 'get_pdb(mod_ptr, destination_folder)': returns the file location of the pdb file for given model_ptr. 
destination_folder has a default value of None, but if provided, the pdb file will be copied to that location,
and then have its address returned 
* 'save_to_out_file(filename)': receives file name, and saves the results to the file.

###Amplitude and FileReaders

The dplus api also contains a module FileReaders. 

It contains `SignalFileReader`, which can be initialized with a path to a signal file (eg a .out or .dat file) 
and will read that file into its `x_vec`, `y_vec`, and `graph` properties.

It also contains `Amplitude`. 

Amplitude has a static method, `load`,  which receives a filename and qmax value and creates 
an instance of the Amplitude class. 

Alternately one can create an empty instance  of Amplitude and then call the function `read_amp`, 
which accomplishes the same thing.  

In addition the class has the following functions:
* q_indices - returns a generator that iterates over each amplitude item in the amplitude array and returns their [q, theta, phi]
* num_indices - return the numbers of  trios [q, theta, phi] in Amplitude file
* complex_amplitude_array - returns a complex array of amplitudes

All this functions assume that the user call 'load' or 'read_amp'.
In case the user didn't call them, the functions return None arrays/ 0 num of indices

The Amplitude class contains three properties, `amp_values` that stores the 
Amplitude values,  `headers`, which stores a list of headers and `step_size` - the "step" between q values.

The function `save` saves the contents of the Amplitude to a new .amp file

```
from dplus.FileReaders import Amplitude
my_amp=Amplitude.load('myamp.amp', qmax)
complexes=my_amp.complex_amplitude_array()
for c in complexes:
    #check that it's correct
    pass
for q, theta, phi in my_amp.q_indices():
    #check that it's correct
    pass
my_amp.save('myamp-modified.amp')
```

##Additional Usage examples

from dplus.CalculationRunner import LocalRunner

exe_directory = r"C:\Program Files\D+\bin"
sess_directory = r"session"

from dplus.State import State
from dplus.DataModels.models import UniformHollowCylinder

sess_directory = r"session"
runner= LocalRunner(session_directory=sess_directory)

uhc=UniformHollowCylinder()

print("Original radius is ", cylinder.layer_params[1]['Radius'].value)
result = API.generate(input)

fit_input = FitInput(input.state, result.graph)
cylinder = fit_input.get_model("test_cylinder")
cylinder.layer_params[1]['Radius'].value = 2
cylinder.layer_params[1]['Radius'].mutable = True

fit_result = API.fit(fit_input)
print(fit_result.parameter_tree)
fit_input.combine_results(fit_result)
print("Result radius is ", cylinder.layer_params[1]['Radius'].value)
```

###Python Fitting
It is possible to fit a curve using the results from Generate and numpy's built in minimization/curve fitting functions.
All that is requires is wrapping the interface code so that it receives and returns parameters the way scipy expects (eg as numpy arrays)

An example follows:

```
import numpy as np
from scipy import optimize
from dplus.CalculationInput import GenerateInput, FitInput
from dplus.CalculationRunner import LocalRunner

input=FitInput.load_from_state_file(r"2_pops.state")
generate_runner=LocalRunner()

def run_generate(xdata, *params):
    '''
    scipy's optimization algorithms require a function that receives an x array and an array of parameters, and
    returns a y array.
    this function will be called repeatedly, until scipy's optimization has completed.
    '''
    input.set_mutable_parameter_values(params) #we take the parameters given by scipy and place them inside our parameter tree
    generate_results=generate_runner.generate(input) #call generate
    return np.array(generate_results.y) #return the results of the generate call

x_data=input.x
y_data=input.y
p0 = input.get_mutable_parameter_values()
method='lm' #lenenberg-marquadt (see scipy documentation)
popt, pcov =optimize.curve_fit(run_generate, x_data, y_data, p0=p0, method=method)

#popt is the optimized set of parameters from those we have indicated as mutable
#we can insert them back into our CalculationInput and create the optmized parameter tree
input.set_mutable_parameter_values(popt)
#we can run generate to get the results of generate with them
best_results=generate_runner.generate(input)
```
