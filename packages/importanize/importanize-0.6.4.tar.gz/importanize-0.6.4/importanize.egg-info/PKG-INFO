        Installing
        ----------
        
        You can install ``importanize`` using pip::
        
            $ pip install importanize
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        I think imports are important in Python. I also think PEP8 is awesome
        (if you disagree, read some PHP) and there are many tools to help
        developers reformat code to match PEP8. There are however fewer tools
        for organizing imports either by following PEP8 or custom rules.
        There is `isort <http://isort.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
        (which unfortunately I found out about after writing this lib)
        however it seems to do lots of magic to determine which packages
        are 3rd party, local packages, etc. I wanted the imports configuration
        to be simple and explicit.
        This is where ``importanize`` comes in. It allows to organize
        Python imports using PEP8 or your custom rules. Read on for
        more information.
        
        Using
        -----
        
        Using ``importanize`` is super easy. Just run::
        
            $ importanize file_to_organize.py
        
        That will re-format all imports in the given file.
        As part of the default configuration, ``importanize`` will try
        it's best to organize imports to follow PEP8 however that is a rather
        challenging task, since it is difficult to determine all import groups
        as suggested by `PEP8 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports>`_:
        
        1) standard library imports
        2) related third party imports
        3) local application/library specific imports
        
        To help ``importanize`` distinguish between different import groups in most
        cases it would be recommended to use custom config file::
        
            $ importanize file_to_organize.py config.json
        
        Config file is simply a ``json`` file like this::
        
            {
                "formatter": "grouped",
                "groups": [
                    {
                        "type": "stdlib"
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "sitepackages"
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "remainder"
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "packages",
                        "packages": [
                            "my_favorite_package"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "local"
                    }
                ]
            }
        
        Default config looks something like::
        
            {
                "groups": [
                    {
                        "type": "stdlib"
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "sitepackages"
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "remainder"
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "local"
                    }
                ]
            }
        
        Currently the only required key is ``"groups"`` which must be an array
        of group definitions. ``importanize`` will use these group definitions
        to organize imports and will output import groups in the same order
        as defined in the config file. These are the supported group types:
        
        * ``stdlib`` - standard library imports including ``__future__``
        * ``sitepackages`` - imports coming from the ``site-packages`` directory
        * ``local`` - local imports which start with ``"."``. for example
          ``from .foo import bar``
        * ``packages`` - if this group is specified, additional key ``packages``
          is required within import group definition which should list
          all Python packages (root level) which should be included in that group::
        
              {
                  "type": "packages",
                  "packages": ["foo", "bar"]
              }
        
        * ``remaining`` - all remaining imports which did not satisfy requirements
          of all other groups will go to this group.
        
        You can use the config file by specifying it in the ``importanize``
        command as shown above however you can also create an ``.importanizerc``
        file and commit that to your repository. As a matter of fact,
        you can see the
        `.importanizerc <https://github.com/miki725/importanize/blob/master/.importanizerc>`_
        config file used for the importanize repository itself.
        Additionally multiple configurations are supported within a single repository
        via sub-configurations. Simply place ``.importanizerc`` within a sub-folder
        and all imports will be reconfigured under that folder.
        
        You can also choose the formatter used to organize long multiline imports.
        Currently, there are two formatters available:
        
        * ``grouped`` (default)
        * ``inline-grouped``
        
        It can be set using the formatter config value, or the formatter option, for
        example::
        
            $ importanize --formatter=inline-group --print tests/test_data/input.txt
        
        
        Finally, you can see all other available ``importanize`` cli options::
        
            $ importanize --help
        
        Not all configurations can be provided via cli.
        Additional available configurations in configuration file:
        
        * ``length`` - line length after which the formatter will split imports
        * ``exclude`` - list of glob patterns of files which should be excluded from organizing.
          For example::
        
                "exclude": [
                    "path/to/file",
                    "path/to/files/ignore_*.py"
                ]
        
        * ``after_imports_new_lines`` - number of lines to be included after imports
        * ``add_imports`` - list of imports to add to every file.
          For example::
        
                "add_imports": [
                    "from __future__ import absolute_import, print_function, unicode_literals"
                ]
        
        It integrates with pre-commit_. You can use the following config
        
        ::
        
            repos:
            - repo: https://github.com/miki725/importanize/
              rev: 'master'
              hooks:
              - id: importanize
                args: [--verbose]
        
        Example
        -------
        
        Here is a before and after using the default formatter(on hypothetical file):
        
        Before
        ~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            from __future__ import unicode_literals, print_function
            import os.path as ospath
            import datetime
            from package.subpackage.module.submodule import CONSTANT, Klass, foo, bar, rainbows
            from .module import foo, bar
            from ..othermodule import rainbows
        
        After
        ~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            from __future__ import print_function, unicode_literals
            import datetime
            from os import path as ospath
        
            from package.subpackage.module.submodule import (
                CONSTANT,
                Klass,
                bar,
                foo,
                rainbows,
            )
        
            from ..othermodule import rainbows
            from .module import bar, foo
        
        Here is what ``importanize`` did:
        
        * alphabetical sort, even inside import line (look at ``__future__``)
        * normalized ``import .. as ..`` into ``from .. import .. as ..``
        * broke long import (>80 chars) which has more than one import
          into multiple lines
        * reordered some imports (e.g. local imports ``..`` should be before ``.``)
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        To run the tests you need to install testing requirements first::
        
            $ make install
        
        Then to run tests, you can use ``nosetests`` or simply use Makefile command::
        
            $ nosetests -sv
            # or
            $ make test
        
        .. _pre-commit: https://pre-commit.com/

        * Added support for ``add_imports`` in configuration.
        
        0.5.3 (2017-06-06)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added support to customize number of new lines added after imports
          via ``after_imports_new_lines`` configuration.
          Useful when using auto formatters such as ``yapf``.
        
        0.5.2 (2017-05-18)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Skipping directories which makes skipping subfolders much faster
        * Fixed bug which incorrectly skipped files
        
        0.5.1 (2017-05-09)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Fixed bug which incorrectly removed duplicate leafless imports which had different ``as`` names

          See ``README`` for more info
        * Added pipe handling (e.g. ``cat foo.py | importanize``)
        * Fixed bug which incorrectly sorted imports with aliases (e.g. ``import foo as bar``)
        * Files are not overridden when imports are already organized.
          Useful in precommit hooks which detect changed files.
        * Released as Python `wheel <http://pythonwheels.com/>`_
        
        0.4.1 (2015-07-28)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Fixed a bug where ``importanize`` did not correctly detect stdlibs on Windows
          (see `#29 <https://github.com/miki725/importanize/issues/29/>`_)
        * Removed ``future`` dependency since ``six>=1.9`` includes all the used features
        * Fixed tests to be executable on Windows
        
        0.4 (2015-04-13)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added multiple formatter options. Can be used using ``--formatter``
          flag or can be set in the configuration file.
        * Fixes a bug in parsing imports when encountering both ``\`` and ``()``
          (see `#26 <https://github.com/miki725/importanize/issues/26>`_ for example)
        * Fixes a bug where wildcard leaf imports were combined with other others
          (see `#25 <https://github.com/miki725/importanize/issues/25/>`_ for example)
        
        0.3 (2015-01-18)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Using tokens to parse Python files. As a result this allows to
          fix how comments are handled
          (see `#21 <https://github.com/miki725/importanize/issues/21>`_ for example)
        
        0.2 (2014-10-30)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * New "exclude" config which allows to skip files

        * Traversing parent paths to find importanize config file
        
        0.1.4 (2014-10-12)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Multiple imports (e.g. ``import a, b``) are normalized
          instead of exiting
        * Multiple imports with the same stem are combined into
          single import statement
          (see `#17 <https://github.com/miki725/importanize/issues/17>`_ for example)
        
        0.1.3 (2014-09-15)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Fixed where single line triple-quote docstrings would cause
          none of the imports to be recognized
        
        0.1.2 (2014-09-15)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Fixed where import leafs were not properly sorted for
          mixed case (aka CamelCase)
        
        0.1.1 (2014-09-07)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Ignoring comment blocks when parsing for imports
        * Fixed bug when imports start on a first line,
          extra lines were being added to the file.
