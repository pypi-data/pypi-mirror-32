# PySWIP

## What's New?

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

**This library is being cleaned up and refactored. Expect API breakage and incompatibility with previous versions.**

Thanks to all [contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.txt). If you have contributed to PySWIP in the past and your name does not appear on that list, please [let me know](mailto:yucetekol@gmail.com) so I can add your name.

## Introduction

PySWIP is a Python - SWI-Prolog bridge enabling to query [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org) in your Python programs.
It features an (incomplete) SWI-Prolog foreign language interface, a utility class that makes it easy querying with Prolog and also a
Pythonic interface.

Since PySWIP uses SWI-Prolog as a shared library and ctypes to access it, it
doesn't require compilation to be installed.

## Requirements:

* Python 2.7 or 3.4 and higher.
    * PyPy is currently not supported.
* SWI-Prolog 7.6.x and higher (most probably other versions will also work).
* libpl as a shared library.
* Works on Linux, Windows and MacOS. Should work on other POSIX.

## Install

See [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) for instructions. **That file is out of date and is being revamped.**

## Examples

### Using Prolog

```python
from pyswip import Prolog
prolog = Prolog()
prolog.assertz("father(michael,john)")
prolog.assertz("father(michael,gina)")
list(prolog.query("father(michael,X)")) == [{'X': 'john'}, {'X': 'gina'}]
for soln in prolog.query("father(X,Y)"):
    print(soln["X"], "is the father of", soln["Y"])
# michael is the father of john
# michael is the father of gina
```

An existing knowledge base stored in a Prolog file can also be consulted,
and queried. Assuming the filename "knowledge_base.pl" and the Python is 
being run in the same working directory, it is consulted like so:

    >>> from pyswip import Prolog
    >>> prolog = Prolog()
    >>> prolog.consult("knowledge_base.pl")

### Foreign Functions

```python
from pyswip import Prolog, registerForeign
def hello(t):
    print("Hello,", t)
hello.arity = 1
registerForeign(hello)
prolog = Prolog()
prolog.assertz("father(michael,john)")
prolog.assertz("father(michael,gina)")    
list(prolog.query("father(michael,X), hello(X)"))
```

### Pythonic interface (Experimental)

```python
from pyswip import Functor, Variable, Query
assertz = Functor("assertz", 2)
father = Functor("father", 2)
call(assertz(father("michael","john")))
call(assertz(father("michael","gina")))
X = Variable()
q = Query(father("michael",X))
while q.nextSolution():
    print "Hello,", X.value
q.closeQuery()
# Outputs:
#    Hello, john
#    Hello, gina

```

The core functionality of ``Prolog.query`` is based on Nathan Denny's public domain prolog.py found at
http://www.ahsc.arizona.edu/~schcats/projects/docs/prolog-0.2.0.html
