Out-of-the-box features available for new concept types
=======================================================

The modular and object-oriented nature of ISO/IEC 11179 and Python encourage reuse
and inheritance when dealing with items. This allows items to have standardised
content and behaviours.

Below is a list of features that are available when making new item types based on
ISO/IEC 11179 *concepts*.

Content creation wizards that encourage reuse
---------------------------------------------
Every item type is provided with a basic 2-step content creation wizard that shows
a user when they may be replicating content that already exists in the registry in an unobtusive way.

This gives freedom to content creators, but gives registry administrators the
peace of mind knowing that the system will encourage reuse where possible.

User-friendly modular editor

Descriptive SEO friendly URLs
-----------------------------

Basic HTML and downloadable PDF templates
-----------------------------------------

The decoupling of the model management and database back-end and Djangos powerful
templating front-end means new item types can be quickly described and prototyped
in code, without having to worry about front-end concerns.

Concepts have a generic fallback template that gives a unified look to new items,
meaning development can be an iterative process.
