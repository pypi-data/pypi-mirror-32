craigslist-monitor
==================

| A monitor for craigslist searches.
| *\*Does not work on Windows.*

The craigslist monitor uses a command line interface to create web
scrapers which monitor craigslist searches for new listings. A scraper
monitoring a search will check periodically for new listings and output
their details into a text file.

Monitoring a craigslist search
------------------------------

First, create a manager which will oversee active scrapers:

::

    cmonitor manager

| **If cmonitor is not installed as a script, try re-installing with** ``sudo pip install craigslist-monitor``

Next, to add a scraper, three things must be specified in the following
order: 1. The name of the scraper (used for stopping the scraper). 2.
The name of the item to be searched and monitored **or** the url of a
craigslist search. 3. The file that the scraper will output details of
new items to.

::

    cmonitor add computer_scraper computer output

The above example of a scraper would monitor
`this <https://craigslist.org/search/sss?query=computer&sort=rel>`__
craigslist search for new listings. There are other options to further
customize the scraper listed under ``cmonitor add --help``.

To stop the scraper:

::

    cmonitor manager -s computer_scraper

Alternatively, to quit both, the manager and any active scrapers:

::

    cmonitor manager -q

Commands/Flags
--------------

Manager
~~~~~~~

-  To list the names of all active scrapers: ``cmonitor manager -l``
-  To quit the manager and all active scrapers: ``cmonitor manager -q``
-  To stop an active scraper: ``cmonitor manager -s <scraper_name>``

Add
~~~

-  If a listing contains words specified by –exclude-words, the scraper
   will not output the details of that listing:
   ``cmonitor add <scraper details> -e [words...]``
-  If –renewals is used, the scraper will output the details of listings
   that have been renewed (off by default):
   ``cmonitor add <scraper details> -r``
-  The two positive digits following –time-refresh are used with
   random.randrange to determine how long (in seconds) until the scraper
   checks for new listing (default is 60 and 180):
   ``cmonitor add <scraper details> -t 200 300``

    positional arguments:

                            monitored.
      output                The file to which items found by the monitor will be

      -t pos_int pos_int, --time-refresh pos_int pos_int
                            The two positive integers used with randrange(lower,
                            upper) to determine how long (in seconds) until the
                            scraper checks for new items (first integer must be
                            lower than the second). The default is 60 and 180.
