Caffeine is a little daemon that sits in your systray, and prevents the
screensaver from showing up, or the system from going to sleep.
It does so when an application is fullscreened (eg: youtube), or when you click
on the systray icon (which you can do, when, eg: reading).

This is a fork of `Caffeine 2.4`_, since later
versions dropped support for the systray icon in favour of only automatic
detection of fullscreen apps only, which resulted rather
`controversial`_.

The intention of this fork is to also evolve on its own, not only fixing
issues, but also implemented missing features, when relevant.

Caffeine-ng was shortly know as Taurine, a play on its successor's name, since
taurine is a known stimulant, commonly found in energy drinks.  However, this
name did not last, since the artwork would not match adequately, and changing
it was undesirable.

Hacking
-------

* To run: ``./bin/caffeine``
* To compile translations: ``./update_translations``

If you want to test out a translation without changing the language for the
whole session: "LANG=ru_RU.UTF-8 ./bin/caffeine" (Replace ru_RU.UTF-8
with whatever language you want to use. You will need to a language pack
for the specific language) Be aware that some stock items
will not be translated unless you log in with a given language.
