    Files (and irrelevant-files) matchers are now overridable.  Zuul
    now uses only branch matchers to collect job variants.  Once those
    variants are collected, they are combined, and the files and
    irrelevant-files attributes are inherited and overridden as any
    other job attribute.  The final values are used to determine
    whether the job should ultimately run.
