## About

Workflow management based on the signac framework.

The signac-flow tool provides the basic components to setup simple to complex workflows for [signac projects](https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/signac).
That includes the definition of data pipelines, execution of data space operations and the submission of operations to high-performance super computers.
