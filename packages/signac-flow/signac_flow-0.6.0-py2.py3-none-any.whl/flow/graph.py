class FlowGraph(object):
    """Define a workflow based on conditions and operations as a graph.

    The ``FlowGraph`` class is designed to simplify the definition of
    more complex workflows, by adding operations to a graph, linking them
    by pre- and post-conditions. The assumption is that an operation is
    *eligible* for operation when the pre-condition is met, and at least
    one of the post-conditions is not met.


    For example, assuming that we a have a *foo* operation, that requires
    a *ready* condition for execution and *should* result in a *started*
    and in a *done* condition, we can express this in graph form like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        g = FlowGraph()
        g.add_operation('foo', prereq=ready, postconds=[started, done])

    The condition functions (``ready``, ``started``, and ``done``) need to
    be implemented as functions with a single argument, for example a
    signac job.

    We can then determine *all* eligible operations within the graph, by
    calling the :py:meth:`~.eligible_operations` method.

    In the example above, the operation was defined as a :py:class:`str`,
    however in principle we can use any object as operation, as long as
    they are uniquely comparable, e.g., an instance of :py:class:`flow.JobOperation`,
    or a callable.

    If we use callables, we can execute all eligible operations for all
    jobs in a project like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        for i in range(max_num_iterations):  # make sure to limit this loop!
            for job in project:
                for op in g.eligible_operations(job):
                    op(job)

    """

    def add_operation(self, operation, prereq=None, postconds=None):
        """Add an operation to the graph.

        This method adds the operation, the optional pre-requirement condition,
        and optional post-conditions to the graph.

        The method will be considered *eligible* for execution when the
        pre-condition is met and at least one of the post-conditions is
        **not** met. The assumption is that the executing the operation
        will eventually lead to all post-conditions to be met.

        The operation may be any object that can be uniquely compared
        via ``hash()``, e.g. a ``str`` or an instance of
        :py:class:`flow.JobOperation` and *callables*.

        All conditions must be callables, with exactly one argument.
