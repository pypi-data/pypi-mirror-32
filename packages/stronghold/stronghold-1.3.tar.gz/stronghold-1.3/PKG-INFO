            + `$ pip install stronghold`
            + `$ stronghold`

            + `$ sudo ./stronghold-script.sh`
        
        3. Download the `stronghold` binary from Releases tab.
        
        
        **Configuration Options**
        ---
        
        1. Firewall
        
            + Turn on Firewall?
                - This helps protect your Mac from being attacked over the internet.
            + Turn on logging?
                - If there IS an infection, logs are useful for determining the source.
            + Turn on stealth mode?
                - Your Mac will not respond to ICMP ping requests or connection attempts from closed TCP and UDP networks.
        
        2. General System Protection
        
            + Enable Gatekeeper?
            	- Defend against malware by enforcing code signing and verifying downloaded applications before allowing them to run.
            + Prevent automatic software whitelisting?
                - Both built-in and downloaded software will require user approval for whitelisting.
            + Disable Captive Portal Assistant and force login through browser on untrusted networks?
                - Captive Portal Assistant could be triggered and direct you to a malicious site WITHOUT any user interaction.
        
        3. User Metadata Storage
        
            + Clear language modeling metadata?
                - This includes user spelling, typing and suggestion data.
            + Disable language modeling data collection?
            + Clear QuickLook metadata?
            + Clear Downloads metadata?
            + Disable metadata collection from Downloads?
            + Clear SiriAnalytics database?
        
        4. User Safety
        
            + Lock Mac as soon as screen saver starts?
            + Display all file extensions?
            	- This prevents malware from disguising itself as another file type.
            + Disable saving documents to the cloud by default?
                - This prevents sensitive documents from being unintentionally stored on the cloud.
            + Show hidden files in Finder?
            	- This lets you see all files on the system without having to use the terminal.
            + Disable printer sharing?
                - Offers redundancy in case the Firewall was not configured.
