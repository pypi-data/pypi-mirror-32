Description: 
        Parses your bloated HTTP access logs to extract the info you want
        about hits from (hopefully) real people instead of just the endless
        stream of hackers and bots that passes for web traffic
        nowadays. Stores the info in a relational database where you can
        access it using all the power of SQL.
        
        Uses the power of your multicore CPU with Twisted_, AsynQueue_, and
        sAsync_ to process log files concurrently and fast. Duplicate entries
        are ignored, so you don't need to fret about redundancies in your
        logfiles. (It happens.) The filtering goes forwards and backwards;
        once an entry has been determined to come from a bad actor, all log
        entries from that IP address are purged and ignored.

        If you see bot garbage getting through and polluting your logs with
        some new attempt at an exploit, just add a rule for it to your rules
        lists, starting with what *logalyzer* comes prepackaged with. The next
        time you run it, those entries will get purged as well.
        
        Optionally produces a list of offender IP addresses that you can use
        to deny access to your web server entirely.
