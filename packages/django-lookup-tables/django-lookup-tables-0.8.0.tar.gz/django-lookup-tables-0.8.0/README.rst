Django Lookup Tables
====================

Efficient storage and management of lookup tables used throughout an
app.

**Note:** This package is a work in progress (that’s why it’s not yet at
version 1.0). I am active seeking contributions to help with making it
more usable, see `“Contributing” <#contributing>`__ below.

Installation
------------

Install the package:

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install django-lookup-tables

Add it to your installed apps:

.. code:: python

   INSTALLED_APPS = (
       ...
       'lookup_tables',
       ...
   )

Usage
-----

In the admin you will see an entry for ‘Lookup Tables’. Here you can add
tables.

Each table has an arbitrary list of items. You can order them by setting
the “Sort Order” field to any positive integer.

Using with Admin-Sortable2
--------------------------

If you have ``django-admin-sortable2`` installed, you can take advantage
of it’s UI enhancements by configuring ``django-lookup-tables`` to use
it. In your ``settings.py``:

.. code:: python

   INSTALLED_APPS = (
       ...
       'adminsortable2',
       'lookup_tables',
       ...
   )

   LOOKUP_TABLES = {
       'USE_ADMIN_SORTABLE2': True,
   }

 ## Contributing

I am actively seeking contributions to this package. Things that need to
be completed for it to be usable generally:

-  Simple way to reference lookup values
-  Simple way to reference lookup tables
-  REST API (using Django Rest Framework) for looking up all the value
   options for a foreign key

If you have suggestions for other features I am open to hearing them.
Use the “Issues” section of the repository to start a conversation.
