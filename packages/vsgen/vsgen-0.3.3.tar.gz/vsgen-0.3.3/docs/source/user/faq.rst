**Q: This doesn't do what I expected.**

Fair enough.  I've already mentioned `Premake <https://premake.github.io/>`_ but as far as I can tell there are two other Python package that generate Visual Studio solution and projects:

#. `makeprojects <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/makeprojects>`_ 
#. `ideskeleton <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ideskeleton>`_

**Q: How do I generate PTVS Projects and Solution?**

Python Tools for Visual Studio functionality is provided by the `vsgen-ptvs <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/vsgen-ptvs>`_ python package.
