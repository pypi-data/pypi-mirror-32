vsgen
======

`vsgen`_ is a Microsoft Visual Studio solution and project generation library.

It is largely inspired by `Premake`_ but after the release of `Python Tools for Visual Studio`_, installing Lua to generate Python projects seemed kind of silly.

It is supported on Python versions 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 and the code is open source, `available on github`_.

This documentation was built from the |version| (|release|) snapshot of the code.
