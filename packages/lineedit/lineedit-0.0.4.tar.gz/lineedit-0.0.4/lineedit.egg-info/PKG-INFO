        It provides some subclasses inherited from [prompt_toolkit](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit) to mimic Julia [LineEdit.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/stdlib/REPL/src/LineEdit.jl) with multiple modal support.
        
        As prompt_toolkit v2.0 is not out yet, we also ship a copy of it for now.
