Description: Lightweight Management and Provisioning Service
        ===============================================
        lMaPS provides a simple way the use schema defined "instances" that can
        be passed to an underlying configuration management system.  This will
        provide the ability to allow desperate systems to use a common namespace
        application scheme to interact directly with configuration management
        systems.
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install lmaps
        ```
        
        ## Overview
        ![System Architecture](.readmeimg/sysarch.png)
        
        ## Example use cases
        
        ### Using lMaPS to reconfigure a host using using ansible
        In this example, an ansible playbook can be written with the expectation
        that a vars file containing the proper data structure will have the
        correct information to turn up a given service.
        
        Let's assume the following playbook /my-playbook.yaml:
        ```
        - name: An example playbook
          hosts: localhost
          connection: local
          vars:
            some_structure:
              - message: This is one
              - message: This is two
              - message: This is three
          tasks:
            - debug:
                msg: '{{ item.message }}'
              with_items: '{{ some_structure }}'
        ```
        Using this, a unit can be defined to call it via the `ansible_playbook`
        unit handler.
        
        We define the unit on the host as /etc/lmaps/units/some_example.yaml:
        ```
        ---
        meta:
          name: some_example
          data_type: YamlKeyList
          store_key: some_structure
          store_root: /some/dir/to/store/instances
        handler:
          name: ansible_some_example
          type: ansible_playbook
          args:
            playbook: /my-playbook.yaml
          params:
            additionalProperties: false
            properties:
              message:
                type: string
        ```
        
        Now when the daemon is run (`lmaps -D`), we can create instances.
        
        With no instances defined, ansible will use the default vars declared
        in the playbook, but if we created the following as hello_world.yaml:
        ```
        message: Hello world!
        ```
        and created it via:
        `lmaps --create --file hello_world.yaml --unit some_example`
        then when applied, the loop will get the following output:
