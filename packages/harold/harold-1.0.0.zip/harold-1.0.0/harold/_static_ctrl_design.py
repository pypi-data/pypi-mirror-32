    """
    A full-state static feedback control design solver for which the following
    quadratic cost function is integrated (summed) over all positive time
    axis ::

                   [x]' [ Q | S ] [x]
        J(x, u) =  [-]  [---|---] [-]
                   [u]  [ S | R ] [u]

    for a continuous-time (discrete-time) system. If the system is given as a
    transfer-function then first a conversion to a state model is performed.
    If the "weight_on" is set to "output" then the cost function is assumed
    to be in the following form ::

                   [x]' [ C | D ]' [ Q | S ] [ C | D ] [x]
        J(x, u) =  [-]  [---|---]  [---|---] [---|---] [-] := J(y, u)
                   [u]  [ 0 | I ]  [ S | R ] [ 0 | I ] [u]

    Based on the provided system, the solution type is automatically selected
    between continuous-time and discrete-time solutions.


    Parameters
    ----------
    G : State, Transfer
        The regulated dynamic system representation
    Q : array_like
        Square, state or output weighting matrix
    R : array_like
        Square input weighting matrix
    S: array_like
        Crossweighting matrix
    weight_on : str, optional
        Depending on its value of "state" or "output", the weights are applied
        on either states or the output.

    Returns
    -------
    K : ndarray
        The regulator K such that A-BK is stable
    X : ndarray
        The stabilizing solution to the corresponding Riccati equation
    eigs : ndarray
        The array of closed loop A-BK eigenvalues.

    Notes
    -----
    For the conditions that weight matrices should satisfy, see SciPy
    documentation over ``solve_continous_are`` and ``solve_discrete_are``.

    Moreover, for the output weighted case, the returned solution is not
    always guaranteed to be the stabilizing solution.
