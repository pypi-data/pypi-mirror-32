        ======
        
        madgui_ is a Qt5 python GUI for interactive accelerator simulations using MAD-X_.
        
        
        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - **Python >= 3.4**
        
          *On linux*, I recommend the latest python version you can find.
        
          *On windows*, I recommend `WinPython 3.4 Qt5`_ (should be about 300MiB in
          size). In particular, you **can not use 64bit python 3.5 and above** on
          windows 10, since there are problems building cpymad for these versions, see
          `hibtc/cpymad#41`_.
        
        - PyQt5_
        
        - cpymad_, in order to work with MAD-X_.
        
          *On windows*, installing cpymad should be as simple as::
        
            pip install cpymad
        
          Otherwise, please refer to cpymad's `installation instructions`_.
        
        .. _WinPython 3.4: https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_3.4/3.4.4.6/
        .. _hibtc/cpymad#41: https://github.com/hibtc/cpymad/issues/41
        .. _installation instructions: http://hibtc.github.io/cpymad/installation/index.html
        .. _MAD-X: http://madx.web.cern.ch/madx
        .. _cpymad: https://github.com/hibtc/cpymad
        .. _PyQt5: https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro
        
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You are now ready to install madgui. Type::
        
            pip install madgui
        
        Or, in order to install from the local checkout::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        If you intend to make changes to the madgui code and want to try the effects
        immediately, use::
        
            python setup.py develop
        
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        Now, you should be able to start madgui with the command::
        
            madgui
        
        or::
        
            python -m madgui
        
        If you are on windows, and nothing happens, you can start madgui manually as
        follows, which may provide you with more error information::
        
            python -c "from madgui.core.app import main; main()"
        
        
        Configuration
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The application loads a YAML config file ``madgui.yml`` in the current
        directory or the user's home directory.
        
        Example file:
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            model_path: ../hit_models
            load_default: hht3
        
            onload: |
              from hit_csys.plugin import Loader
              frame.add_online_plugin(Loader)
        
        Note that the onload handler can be used to execute user-defined code, import
        modules and e.g. add loaders for online control plugins. The API is defined in
        the ``madgui.online.api`` module.
        
        
        Development guidelines
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        **Coding:**
        
        - Try to be consistent with PEP8_ and PEP257_.
        - Add `sphinx`_ style docstrings for all modules, classes, functions
        - Check regularly for unused imports etc with ``pyflakes madgui``
        
        .. _PEP8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
        .. _PEP257: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
        .. _`sphinx`: http://sphinx-doc.org/
        
        **Naming:**
        
        - Stick to ``names_with_underscores`` for methods and variable names as
          recommended by PEP8_ (I admit that the code base is currently somewhat
          inconsistent in this regard)
        - class names are in ``CamelCase``
        - only PyQt class method overrides and their parameters shall be written in
          ``lowerCamelCase``
        
        **Version control:**
        
        Commits should be reversible, independent units if possible. Use descriptive
        titles and also add an explaining commit message unless the modification is
        trivial. See also: `A Note About Git Commit Messages`_.

        CHANGELOG
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        1.9.0
        -----
        Date: 16.04.2018
        
        Improvements:
        
        - add x/y/px/py values to *Twiss* tab in element info dialog
        - replot backtracked twiss on every new monitor readout
        - consider ``SBEND->K0`` when detecting knobs
        - remove conversion mechanism for knobs, this is now the responsibility of the
          model itself (by using appropriate expressions) or the online plugin
        - use only user defined variables in deferred expressions as knobs, consider
          fixed numbers as static
        - show marks with monitor width/position when opening monitor dialog, can
          select which ones to show
        - add update/backtrack functionality to monitor widget
        - show unit on the column title
        - add simple data export for monitors
        - make the monitorwidget child to the main window (so it will be closed like
          everything else when the main window is closed)
        - persist some settings across multiple madgui runs using *session* files:
          main window size/position, model, folder, selected monitors
        - enable grid in twiss plot (mainly for y=0)
        - add ``onload`` config entry for application, and in model
        - remove setuptools based entrypoint for online models, must be manually
          loaded by the user using the ``onload`` handler instead
        - draw element markers at the exit end of the element
        - unify log window with MAD-X input commands, output, as well as logging
          records, based on PlainTextEdit with extra selections in different colors,
          much easier on the eyes and hands! Shows line numbers and times on the left.
        - show exceptions in log window as well
        - silence Pint redefinition warning
        - log interleaved MAD-X input/output in chronological order!
        - display line numbers for config edit dialog (multi grid)
        - show only the actual MAD-X command parameters in the second info tab
        - add ``kick`` attribute for SBEND in summary tab
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        - fix exception on py34: missing ``math.isclose``
        - fix exception in floor plan
        - fix error in matching due to discarding ``Expression``
        - fix unit conversion for gantry angle
        - fix multi grid with ``assign`` in config file
        - use float edit boxes for target values
        - fix input unit of multi-grid target values
        - fix bug with disappearing monitor widget (GC related)
        
        Internal changes:
        
        - use function call syntax to get the values from Bool proxies
        - remove some remaining py2 compatibility code
        - support attribute access and *on_change* signals for config entries, make
          ``config.NumberFormat`` a simple config entry
        - rename ``user_ns`` to ``context``
        - cleanup some unused imports, undefined names etc (pyflakes)
        - replace ``monospace`` function by a simpler one without ``size`` parameter
        - remove uppercase restritcion when accessing element attributes
        - adapt to changes in cpymad 1.0 API
        - flip definition of ``gantry_angle`` (``SROTATION->ANGLE`` has changed in
          MAD-X 5.04.00)

            - fix swapped ellipse axes when alpha is negative
            - fix swapped formulas for the half axes
        
        - units:
            - pass values internally as plain floats, convert only for IO/UI (#2)
            - Replace all Expression instances by their values, get rid of
              SymbolicValue
            - introduce globals for ``madx_units`` and ``ui_units`` used for
              conversion

        First reference point to define somewhat stable versions.
        
        List of features:
        
        - cpymad/pytao as simulation backends
        - plots: alfa/beta/envelope/orbit; and the ones defined by tao
        - integrated python shell (ipython/jupyter) not very useful as of yet:
          limited exhibition of objects, no convenient APIs provided (plotting)
        - log tab that shows madx/tao output
        - tab that shows madx/tao commands
        - display and edit box for beam parameters; initial conditions (i.e. twiss);
          and element attributes (read-only so far)
        - 2D floor plan
        - matching (interactive + dialog)
        - emittance (dialog)
        - orbit alignment: 2-grid + N+optic methods
