        > Note
        
         Simple-lockfile uses a file as a lock system.
        
        ## Coencept
        
        ## How to use
        
        The following example is based on Django project. With this module, you can lock a view method in your app.
        
        ```settings.py
        
        from simple_lock import SimpleLock
        
        # ~~~
        
        File.set_root_path('/home/hoge/')
        # A lockfile is created in the root_path directory without setting path as arguments.
        
        ```
        
        
        ```app/view.py
        
        from response_lockfile import lock_lockfile
        
        # ~~~
        
        @lock_view(name='lockfile1.lock')
        def view():
            #some_logic
            return HttpResponse()
        ```
        
        This decoreator creates lockfile1.lock and releases.
        
        ```app2/view.py
        
        from response_lockfile import watch_lockfile
        
        # ~~~
        
        @watch_lockfile(name='lockfile1.lock')
        def view():
            return HttpResponse()
        ```
        
        If lockfile1.lock exists when execute app2/view:view, this decoreator returns a http response.
