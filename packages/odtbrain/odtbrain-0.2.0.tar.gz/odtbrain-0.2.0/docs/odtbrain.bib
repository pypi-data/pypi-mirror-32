  Title                    = {{Single-cell diffraction tomography with optofluidic rotation about a tilted axis}},
  Abstract                 = {Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) is a tomographic technique that can be used to measure the three- dimensional (3D) refractive index distribution within living cells without the requirement of any marker. In principle, ODT can be regarded as a generalization of optical projection tomography which is equivalent to com- puterized tomography (CT). Both optical tomographic techniques require projection-phase images of cells mea- sured at multiple angles. However, the reconstruction of the 3D refractive index distribution post-measurement differs for the two techniques. It is known that ODT yields better results than projection tomography, because it takes into account diffraction of the imaging light due to the refractive index structure of the sample. Here, we apply ODT to biological cells in a microfluidic chip which combines optical trapping and microfluidic flow to achieve an optofluidic single-cell rotation. In particular, we address the problem that arises when the trapped cell is not rotating about an axis perpendicular to the imaging plane, but instead about an arbitrarily tilted axis. In this paper we show that the 3D reconstruction can be improved by taking into account such a tilted rotational axis in the reconstruction process.},

  Abstract                 = {Analyzing the three-dimensional (3D) refractive index distribution of a single cell makes it possible to describe and characterize its inner structure in a marker-free manner. A dense, full-view tomographic data set is a set of images of a cell acquired for multiple rotational positions, densely distributed from 0 to 360 degrees. The reconstruction is commonly realized by projection tomography, which is based on the inversion of the Radon transform. The reconstruction quality of projection tomography is greatly improved when first order scattering, which becomes relevant when the imaging wavelength is comparable to the characteristic object size, is taken into account. This advanced reconstruction technique is called diffraction tomography. While many implementations of projection tomography are available today, there is no publicly available implementation of diffraction tomography so far.},

  Abstract                 = {The theory of tomographical imaging with limited angular input, from which two reconstruction algorithms are derived, is discussed. The existence of missing information because of incomplete angular coverage is demonstrated, and an iteration algorithm to recover this information from a priori knowledge of the finite extent of the object is developed. Smoothing algorithms to stabilize reconstructions in the presence of noise are given. The effects of digitization and finite truncation of the reconstruction region in numerical computation are also analyzed. It is shown that the limited-angle problem is governed by a set of eigenvalues whose spectrum is determined by the imaging angle and the finite extent of the object. The distortion on a point source caused by the missing information is calculated; from the results some properties of the iteration scheme, such as spatial uniformity, are derived.},
