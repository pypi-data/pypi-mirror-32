        ========
        
        **pysetenv** is a simple Python-based program to allow users to set
        environment variables before executing a command. While it's
        cross-platform, it's primarily designed to be used on Windows, where
        ``cmd.exe`` makes this considerably more difficult than on POSIX
        systems.
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        pysetenv is designed as a support package to help authors of other
        Python packages create command-line strings like you'd expect from
        ``sh`` or the ``env`` command. Generally, pysetenv will only be
        installed on Windows systems, with POSIX systems using ``sh`` or
        ``env``. For example, in your ``setup.py``, you would write:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            setup(
                # ...
                install_requires=['pysetenv;platform_system=="Windows"'],
            )
