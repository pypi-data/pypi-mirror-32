Description: Manyconfig
        ##########
        
        An easy-to-use declarative loader of configuration
        
        What does it do?
        ================
        
        Manyconfig lets you describe your configuration using simple blocks. You can
        then load this configuration in a simple statement, even if it is scattered
        across various file and environment variables.
        
        We call these descriptions a MetaConfig not to confuse them with the
        configuration itself, which is the result of loading a MetaConfig.
        
        I can't leverage Manyconfig for my use case!
        ============================================
        
        If that's the case, please tell me. Manyconfig is still in its early days, so
        this is bound to happen. I'll happily add building blocks if it enables more
        use cases.
