        # Developer Guide
        
        ## Setting Up The Environment
         - ### Setup VirtualEnv (Recommended But Optional)
           ```bash
           pip install virtualenv
           virtualenv env
           source ./env/bin/activate
           ```
         - ### Install Dependencies
           ```bash
           pip install .[dev]
           ```
         -  ### Install pre-commit hooks
            The project uses various pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality and standards. Therefore, it is really necessary for all the contributors to install these and run before every commit else the contributions will be rejected.
        
            ##### Steps
            ```bash
            pre-commit install
            ```
        
        ## Running Tests
         - ### Install Dependencies
           ```bash
           pip install .[test]
           ```
         - ### Run the Tests
           - #### With Coverage Report (Recommended)
             ```
             nosetests --cover-erase --cover-package=pyDownload --with-coverage --cover-branches
             ```
           - #### Without Coverage Report
             ```
             nosetests --cover-erase --cover-package=pyDownload  --cover-branches
             ```
