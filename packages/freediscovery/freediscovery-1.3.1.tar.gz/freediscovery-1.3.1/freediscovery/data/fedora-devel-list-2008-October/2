This seems more a complaint that tab completion is different from what you're 
used to. Many users feel the opposite (they add sbin to PATH in their 
dotfiles) and won't notice the change. For users new to linux and Fedora, 
sbin being in PATH gives them a better user experience than 'bash: foo: 
command not found' errors when they try to follow some guide on the web.
