Heh. Well, I also have had sudo compiled with /sbin and /usr/sbin in its
secure path, so sudo command (and sudo com[tab] with bash_completion) has
worked correctly for me for years. And if there's an admin command that I'm
for some reason running not as root it should a) be moved out of sbin or b)
I probably at least want to think about it and so typing the path doesn't
hurt.
