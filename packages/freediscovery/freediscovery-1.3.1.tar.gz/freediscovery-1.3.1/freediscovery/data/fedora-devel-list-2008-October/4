I personally have come to like typing the full paths for /sbin /usr/sbin
stuff, only problem is, sometimes things that one would feel is more
appropriate in /sbin isn't there (setenforce etc).

I haven't added such to my . files for such a long time it's not funny,
to the point where just typing 'ifconfig' before felt unnatural...

I can however live with either, I literally don't give a damn and it
doesn't bother me... :)
