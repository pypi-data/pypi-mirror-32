Utils for the online [fast.ai](www.fast.ai) course

## Installation

## Prerequisites 

## `fetchImagesAndPrepForClassification`

Utility for Lesson 1 experimentation with external classes. The script:
* Downloads images from google images download for specific classes
* Sanity check that images can be opened and have three channels
* Organises the images into separate folders (train/valid/test + classes) as expected by the fast.ai library

### Quick example

```python
from duckgoose import fetchImagesAndPrepForClassification

# dictionary structure `class_name => search term`
image_classes = { 'ducks' : 'ducks -rubber' , 'geese' : 'geese' }
download_path = '/home/myuser/data/downloaded_from_google'
output_path = '/home/myuser/data/ducksgeese/'
number_of_images = 100

fetchImagesAndPrepForClassification(image_classes, download_path, output_path, number_of_images)
```
