Dashboard for automatic monitoring of Flask web-services.

The Flask Monitoring Dashboard is an extension that offers four main functionalities with little effort from the Flask developer:
- **Monitor the Flask application:**
Our Dashboard allows you to see which endpoints process a lot of request and how fast. 
Additionally, it provides information about the evolving performance of an endpoint throughout different versions if youâ€™re using git.
- **Monitor your test coverage:**
The dashboard allows you to find out which endpoints are covered by unit tests, allowing also for integration with Travis for automation purposes. 
For more information, see [this file](http://flask-monitoringdashboard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functionality.html#test-coverage-monitoring).
- **Collect extra information about outliers:**
Outliers are requests that take much longer to process than regular requests. 
The dashboard automatically detects that a request is an outlier and stores extra information about it (stack trace, request values, Request headers, Request environment).
- **Visualize the collected data in a number useful graphs:**
The dashboard is automatically added to your existing Flask application.
You can view the results by default using the default endpoint (this can be configured to another route):

    [/dashboard](http://localhost:5000/dashboard)
