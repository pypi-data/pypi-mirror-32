The default configuration settings in a single string constant.
Use this declaration as a template configuration file.

The configuration loader :mod:`mqttgateway.utils.load_config` only
considers sections and options that are already present in this string
and disregard anything else.  If a section or option is found in a configuration
file but is not listed here, it will not be taken into account.  Only
sections and options already here are taken into account when found in a configuration
file, and then they overwrite the default values defined here.

The only exception is the ``[INTERFACE]`` section which is reserved to the configuration
parameters needed by the interface being implemented.  The section itself is defined here
but no options are present as those are defined by the developper, and those are the only
options that the loader will take into account.

CONFIG = '''
[CONFIG]
# Reserved section used by the loader to store the location where
#   the configuration settings are coming from, or to store
#   the error if there was one.

[INTERFACE]
# Section for whatever options are needed by the gateway interface
#   being developed. All these options will be written in a
#   dictionary and passed to the interface.

[MQTT]
# The parameters to connect to the MQTT broker
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 1883
keepalive: 60

# The client id can be provided here; if left empty it defaults to the application name
clientid:

# This is the timeout of the 'loop()' call in the MQTT library
timeout: 0.01

# Mapping option. By default it is off.
mapping: off

# Map file: there needs to be a mapping file if the <mapping> option is on.
#   If the <mapfilename> option is left blank, the mapping option is turned
#   off, whatever the value of the <mapping> option.
#   To use the default name and path, use a dot <.> for this option.
#   The default name used is <*application_name*.map>.
#   See below for other instructions on file names and paths.
mapfilename: .

# The 'root' keyword for all MQTT messages.
#   Only necessary if <mapping> is off, disregarded otherwise
#   as the keyword should then be found in the mapping file.
root: home

# The topics to subscribe to, separated by a comma.
#   Only necessary if <mapping> is off, disregarded otherwise
#   as the topics should then be found in the mapping file.
topics: home/dummyfunction/#, home/+/dummy/#

[LOG]
# Log file: all WARN level logs and above are sent to stderr or equivalent.
#   To log levels below that a file location is needed.
#   Leave this option blank to not enable a log file.
#   Use a dot <.> to use the default name and path.
#   The default name used is <*application_name*.log>.
#   Make sure the process will have the rights to write in this file.
#   See below for other instructions on file names and paths.
logfilename:

# Turn debug 'on' if logging of all DEBUG level messages is required, otherwise its INFO
debug: off

# Console level: use NONE for no console output, otherwise the level wanted.
#   Logs will be directed to stdout.  Levels are the ones from the logging module:
#   CRITICAL, ERROR, WARN or WARNING, INFO and DEBUG.
consolelevel: NONE

# Email credentials; leave empty if not required.
#   All CRITICAL level logs are sent to this email, if defined.
#   For now there is no authentication.
emailhost:
# for example: emailhost: 127.0.0.1
emailport:
# for example: emailport: 25
emailaddress:
# for example: address: me@example.com

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Note on file paths and names:
#   - the default name is 'application_name' +
#                          default extension (.log, .map, ... etc);
#   - the default directories are (1) the configuration file location, (2) the
#     current working directory, (3) the application directory, which
#     'should' be the location of the launching script;
#   - empty file paths have different meaning depending where they are used;
#     best to avoid;
#   - file paths can be directory only (ends with a '/') and are appended with
#     the default name;
#   - file paths can be absolute or relative; absolute start with a '/' and
#     relative are prepended with the default directory;
#   - file paths can be file only (no '/' whatsoever) and are prepended with
#     the default directory;
#   - use forward slashes '/' in any case, even for Windows systems, it should
#     work;
#   - however for Windows systems, use of the drive letter might be an issue
#     and has not been tested.
