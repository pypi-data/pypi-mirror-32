class Colony:
    """ Implements the artificial bee colony algorithm.
    
    Args:
        objective: objective function called by each bee at each food source.
            Must return a "honey" value that will be maximized by the colony.
        params: dictionary of optimization parameters and their ranges::

    Keyword Args:
        num_bees: number of employed bees in the colony, i.e. number of
            solutions searched at each iteration of the algorithm.
        limit: number of trails without improvement at a food source before it
            is "depleted" and the colony moves on to new food sources.
        max_iter: maximum number of loops through the colonies fit function.

            times equal to::

            responsible for exploring, i.e. the number of additional random
            guesses made at every iteration of the fit function.
            
    Properties:
        is_initialized: indicates whether the colony has been initialized and
            is ready to be fit.
        colony: list of Bee objects that make up the colony.
        food: list of food values for each bee in the colony.
