# crypko.py

Install using `pip install crypko.py`.

Provides a simple wrapper around the Crypko platform allowing users to
search for crypko, purchase crypko, fuse crypko, etc.

More features are slowly being added as I work on them. If any part of
this stops working because the Crypko platform has been updated, let
me know and I'll try and fix it.
