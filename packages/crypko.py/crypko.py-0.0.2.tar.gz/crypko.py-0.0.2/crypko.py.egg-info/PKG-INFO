Description: # crypko.py
        
        Install using `pip install crypko.py`.
        
        Provides a simple wrapper around the Crypko platform allowing users to
        search for crypko, purchase crypko, fuse crypko, etc.
        
        More features are slowly being added as I work on them. If any part of
        this stops working because the Crypko platform has been updated, let
        me know and I'll try and fix it.
