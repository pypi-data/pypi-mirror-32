Description: =========
        crypko.py
        =========
        
        Install using ``pip install crypko.py``.
        
        Provides a simple wrapper around the Crypko platform allowing users to
        search for crypko, purchase crypko, fuse crypko, etc.
        
        More features are slowly being added as I work on them. If any part of
        this stops working because the Crypko platform has been updated, let
        me know and I'll try and fix it.
        
        Basic usage:
        ============
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          >>> import crypko
          >>> api = crypko.API()
          >>> num, results = api.search(owner_addr='0xCa39E90CeC69838e73CC4F24Ec5077daC44B47d6', attributes='glasses')
          >>> num
          116
          >>> next(resuls)
          <crypko.objects.Crypko object at 0x7f01d9ded240>
          >>> print(next(results))
          Crypko #168993 SALE
          >>> c = next(results)
          >>> c.image
          'https://img.crypko.ai/daisy/9753747176b22ea4fdb120f308073c35930c38a6_lg.jpg'
          >>> c.details.matron
          <crypko.objects.Crypko object at 0x7f1d39348e10>
          >>> c.details.owner.username
          'Bottersnike'
