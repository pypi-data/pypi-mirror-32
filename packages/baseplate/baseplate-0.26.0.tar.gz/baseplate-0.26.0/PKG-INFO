        Baseplate is a library to build services on. Its goal is to provide all
        the common things a service needs with as few surprises as possible,
        including:
        
        -  compatibility with Python 2.7 and Python 3.4+
        -  transparent diagnostic information collection (metrics, tracing,
           logging)
        -  configuration parsing
        -  gevent-based Thrift and WSGI servers meant to run under
           `Einhorn <https://github.com/stripe/einhorn>`__
        -  and various helper libraries like a Thrift client pool
