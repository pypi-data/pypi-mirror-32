The common way to install **subcmd** is using pip:

::

    $ pip install subcmd

Upgrade is also trivial:

::

    $ pip install --upgrade subcmd

Also if you prefer, download sources and install manually:

Install from sources
--------------------

Installation from sources is based in python setuptools.

Stable version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Current stable version is |version|

.. raw:: html

   <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">
   <a href="" class="btn">
   <i class="icon-download"></i>
   Download stable version
   </a>
   </p>

Development version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Trunk source code is not always stable, please look at our current issues
for help and troubleshooting.

.. raw:: html

   <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">
   <a href="" class="btn">
   <i class="icon-download"></i>
   Download trunk version
   </a>
   </p>


Installing from sources involves the following steps:

::

    tar xvzmf subcmd-*.tar.gz
    cd subcmd
    python setup install

To upgrade just download another version and proceed like a normal
installation.

For old versions and active development branches please, refer to the
project Github `pages <http://github.com/repejota/subcmd>`_.

Once you have installed proceed to read the quick :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>` or 
the in depth :ref:`manual <manual>` and start to work with **subcmd**.
