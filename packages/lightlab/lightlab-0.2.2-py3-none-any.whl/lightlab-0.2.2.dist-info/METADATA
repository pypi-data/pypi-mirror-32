Description: Lightlab
        ========
        
        A python library for remote laboratory control. Laboratory remoting greatly facilitates experimental
        research through access from anywhere, large dataset gathering, storage, and analysis,
        repeatability, live status and progress monitoring, intra- and inter-group collaboration.
        
        Philosophy of a modern lab: https://www.readthedocs.io (not yet)
        
        Includes: - A shared library of instrument drivers - Representation of state for labs of multiple
        users - Driver-independent abstractions of instruments - Utilities for data structures, advanced
        sweeping, search procedures, spectrum analysis, and characterization - Constructs of laboratory
        virtualization for repeatability and rapid user code development - Detailed documentation of tips,
        tricks, and instructions for prepping your lab for remoting
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        From PyPI:
        
        ::
        
            pip install lightlab
        
        or from source on github: (not yet)
        
        ::
        
            git clone <project url>
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        1. Configure GPIB/ethernet communication on an instrumentation server
        2. Initialize the representation of your lab's state
        3. Write a driver or use an existing one
        4. Read the documentation
        5. Get going!
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Contains full instructions for getting started and setting up your lab and workflow.
        
        Hosted on readthedocs here (not yet)
        
        Contributing
        ------------
        
        We welcome contributions, especially for new drivers. Fork the repo to your github user account and
        clone from there. Please unittest your contributions in a repeatable virtual laboratory; test the
        driver in experiment, not unittests; then create a pull request.
        
        Supported platforms
        -------------------
        
        Server: Mac OS and Linux running â‰¥python3.6; not tested on Windows (to do).
