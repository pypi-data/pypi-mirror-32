Description: Lightlab
        ========
        
        A python library for remote laboratory control. Laboratory remoting facilitates experimental research:
        * access from anywhere
        * large dataset gathering, storage, and analysis
        * repeatability
        * real-time status and progress monitoring,
        * intra- and inter-group collaboration
        
        This package includes:
        * A shared library of instrument drivers
        * Representation of state for labs of multiple users
        * Driver-independent abstractions of instruments
        * Utilities for data structures, advanced sweeping, search procedures, spectrum analysis, and characterization
        * Constructs of laboratory virtualization for repeatability and rapid user code development
        * Detailed documentation of tips, tricks, and instructions for prepping your lab for remoting
        
        Here is our `philosophy <http://lightlab.readthedocs.io/en/development/_static/gettingStarted/engineersGuide.html>`__ of how a modern lab can look.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        From PyPI:
        
        ::
        
            pip install lightlab
        
        From source:
        
        ::
        
            git clone git@github.com:lightwave-lab/lightlab.git
            cd lightlab
            make venv
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        1. Configure GPIB/ethernet communication on an `instrumentation server <http://lightlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/gettingStarted/sysadmin.html>`__
        2. Initialize the representation of your `lab state <http://lightlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/developers/labState.html>`__
        3. `Write a driver <http://lightlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/tutorials/drivers/drivers.html>`__ or use an existing one
        4. Read about advanced features and `tutorials <http://lightlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/tutorials/index.html>`__
        5. Get going!
