# fanalysis

fanalysis is a Python module for Factorial Analysis distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

With this fanalysis package, you can perform:
- Simple Correspondence Analysis
- Multiple Correspondence Analysis
- Principal Components Analysis

Those statistical methods can be used in two ways:
- as descriptive methods ("datamining approach")
- as reduction methods in scikit-learn pipelines ("machine learning approach")
