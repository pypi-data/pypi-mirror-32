Description: # Singularity Python
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/singularityware/singularity-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/singularityware/singularity-python)
        
        Singularity Python is a python module and command line tool to provide helpers for working with <a href="https://singularityware.github.io" target="_blank">Singularity</a> containers, specifically providing functions to visualize, package, and compare containers. 
        
         - If you are looking for the Singularity Python client to pull, build, and otherwise wrap Singularity functions, then please see the repository [singularity-cli](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-cli) for the [spython](https://pypi.org/project/spython/) module.
         - If you are looking for local management and interaction with various storage locations (e.g., to pull and inspect containers in Singularity Hub, Registry, or other cloud resource) then please see the [Global Client](https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry-cli) for the `sregistry` module.
        
        ## Install
        You have the option to install only the dependencies that are needed for your functionality of interest.
        
        ```bash
        # All
        pip install singularity
        
        # Metrics and analysis dependencies
        pip install singularity[metrics]
        
        # Building on Google Cloud
        pip install singularity[google[
        ```
        
        
        We currently require Python > version 3 to use various timezone functions. If you are unable to install version 3.0, we provide a [Singularity.container](Singularity.container) for you to use instead. This is the recommended approach as some older versions of Python do not support generation of the timestamp. See the [installation docs](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity-python/wiki/Installation) for your different options.
