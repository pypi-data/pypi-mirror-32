Description: ==============
        McsPyDataTools 
        ==============
        
        This package contains Python tools, classes and functions, to handle data recorded 
        and processed with Hard- and Software produced by 
        'Multi Channel Systems MCS GmbH <http://www.multichannelsystems.com>'_.
        
        Feature list
        ============
        
        * Read HDF5 data files that are compliant to the MCS-HDF5 Raw-Data protocol v. 3 
        (usually generated by the HDF5 export function of the Multi Channel DataManager)
        
        * Read data files that are compliant to the HDF5 based MCS-CMOS-MEA RawData format
        CMOS-MEA RawData protocol v. 1 (generated by CMOS-MEA-Control) and ProcessedData 
        format CMOS-MEA ProcessedData v. 1 (generated by CMOS-MEA-Tools)
        
        * Provides structures to get the recorded raw ADC integer values and the meta data 
        of every stream
        
        * Provides methods to get the measured values and timestamps in the correct context
        of the recording (scale, physical unit, ... etc.) 
        
        Test file archive
        =================
        
        The McsPyDataTools package is accompanied by a separate archive that contains the 
        the raw data files used by the unit tests. The content of this test file archive must 
        be copied to the folder **...\McsPy\Test\TestData\** to be used by the unit tests.
