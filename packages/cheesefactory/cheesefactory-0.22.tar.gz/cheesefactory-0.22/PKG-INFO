Description: Wrappers for report-making with dataframes.
        
        If you like using dataframes in Pandas and want to spit the results into an Excel or CSV and want to have the option to transfer the report to a remote SFTP server, then this package may be for you.
        
        If you want to export non-dataframe results into an Excel or CSV and want to have the option to transfer the report to a remote SFTP server, then this package may be for you.
        
        ###Background
        Yes!  I know that Pandas has a lot of goodies built into it for doing the Excel and CSV thing, but this  
        
        I provide a number of daily reports to clients in the form of Excel and CSV files.  Sometimes, these clients need the information transferred to an SFTP server.
        
        As you may imagine, the first thing I did was create a framework for these reports so I wouldn't have to repeat most of my work.  Thus, CheeseFactory was born.
        
        The idea here is that I would have Python wrappers for my most used packages:  
        * PostgreSQL (psycopg2)
        * MSSQL (pyodbc)
        * Email (builtin)
        * Excel (xlsxwriter)
        * CSV (builtin)
        
        And then I'd have a basic report class (cf_report.py) that brings everything together.  I never use the basic report class directly--I create create a child classes for each particular data source.
        
        This package was originally intended for me and the other data scientists I associate with.  I was very surprised when I saw that, according to PePy (http://pepy.tech/count/cheesefactory), it had been downloaded over 2500 times within its first 90 days of being in the wild!
        
        So, for the benefit of others, I've decided to pretty things up and describe how CheeseFactory may be able to help you.
        
        If you have any questions or constructive suggestions, please contact me.
        
        ###What do I mean by "wrapper"?
        I've taken the packages that I use the most and pre-configured them with the configurations that I use 99% of the time.
