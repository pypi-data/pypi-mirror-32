class VNDB:
    """
        Start up a vndb instance. This instance allows you to communicate with the VNDB d11 api. If you pass a username
        and password it will log you in as that user automatically. Since there can only be one user per connection,
        you will need to call this multiple times to log in as more than one user. However, this is possible.
        Simply create multiple instances. However, keep in mind that you can only ever have 10 connections per IP
        and 200 commands per 10 minutes per IP and 1 second of SQL time per minute per IP, so I doubt that multiple
        connections will be very fruitful.

                            This is kind of special. You need to pass them in the form <filter><op>"<term>"
                            for strings or <filter><op><number> for numbers. This is counter intuitive.
                            Also, per the docs, <filter>=<number> doesn't do what we think, use >, >= or < and <=.
