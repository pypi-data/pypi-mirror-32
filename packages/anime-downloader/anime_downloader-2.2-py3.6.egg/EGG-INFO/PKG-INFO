        Yeah. Me too! That's why this tool exists.
        
        ## Features
        
        - Download or stream any episode or episode range of any anime.
        - Specify the quality you want to stream or download.
        - Search available if don't want to copy the url.
        - Save yourselves from those malicious ads.
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install the stable release from PyPI.
        ```bash
        $ pip install anime-downloader
        ```
        
        To install the dev version
        ```bash
        $ pip install -U git+https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader.git
        ```
        *NOTE: You might have to use pip3 depending on your system*
        
        ## Usage
        
        Anime downloader has two sub commands, `dl` and `watch`. `watch` does nothing currently (but when it does, it will be awesome!).
        
        Run `anime dl --help` for help text on `dl` subcommand.
        
        ```
        $ anime dl --help

        ### To use `anime_downloader` in your package
        
        This tool can be used as a library. This means you can import it into your own application and search for anime and do many other wonderful things.
        See [documentation](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader/blob/master/package_usage.md).

        - Support for more sites
        
        *Please don't judge me for not paying for anime. I want to support these animation studios, but being a college student, I can't.*
