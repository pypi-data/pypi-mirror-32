        This game offers two modes:
        
        -  A first one, available during the first two levels where the player
           plays against a wall.
        
        -  A second, from the third level, allowing artificial intelligence (AI)
           to appear in the game, increasing the similarities with the
           traditional pong game.
        
        **NOTE:** the speed of the game gradually increases with each game.
        Similarly, it increases as you move to the next level.
