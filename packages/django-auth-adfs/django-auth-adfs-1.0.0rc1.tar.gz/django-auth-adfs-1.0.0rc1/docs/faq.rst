Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**Why am I always redirected to** ``/accounts/profile/`` **after login?**
    It's default Django behaviour. You can change it by setting the Django setting named
    `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#login-redirect-url>`_.

**How do I store additional info about a user?**
    django_auth_adfs can only store information in existing fields of the user model.
    If you want to store extra info, you'll have to extend the default user model.
    `You can read about how to do it here <https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/07/22/how-to-extend-django-user-model.html#abstractuser>`_
