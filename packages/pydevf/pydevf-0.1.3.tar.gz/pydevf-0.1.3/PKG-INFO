        Features
        ==========
        
        This package provides a command line API to use the PyDev Code Formatter (the PyDev
        Code formatter is created by extracting the engine for code formatting provided by
        PyDev: http://www.pydev.org).
        
        The PyDev Formatter is a conservative python code formatter and will try to keep the 
        structure of the code as close as possible to the original sources, while fixing many
        common issues such as:
        
        - Keep a space after commas
        - Trim spaces inside parenthesis
        - Right-trim lines
        - Add a space before and after operators
        - Keep 2 lines before top level classes/methods
        - Keep 1 line before inner classes/methods
        - Add new line at end of file
        - Format comments to have 2 spaces before a comment and 1 space inside the comment
        
        And will not try to break statements to fit any pre-specified line length (as gofmt).
        
        Command line
        =============
        
        To use the formatter use:
         
        `python -m pydevf <filename_or_directory>`
        
        `python -m pydevf -h` may be used to see the help for additional parameters.
        
        Installing
        ============
        
        Requisites
        -----------
        
        - java 8+ (so, make sure java is installed and in your PATH)
        - python 2.7 or 3.4 onwards
        - click 6+
        
        Install with pip
        -----------------
        
        `pip install pydevf` should be used to install the PyDev Formatter.
        
        Dealing with big lines
        ========================
        
        Note that in PyDev there are tools to help on those manual cases. i.e.:
        
        Wrap docstrings/comments with `Ctrl+2, W` -- See: http://pydev.blogspot.com/2015/04/wrapping-docstringscomments-in-pydev.html.
        
        Wrap/unwrap lists/calls with `Ctrl+1`, `Wrap expression`/`unwrap expression` (used with cursor inside the list/call).
        
        Daemon mode
        ============
        
        By default the formatter will create a daemon and will reuse it among multiple invocations (because
        the formatter is **very fast** but its startup is slow). If you don't want to use this mode use
        the `--no-daemon` parameter.
