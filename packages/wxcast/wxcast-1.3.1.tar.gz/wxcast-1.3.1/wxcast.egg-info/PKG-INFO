        ## Usage
        
        ###  METAR
        
        Provides the METAR information for a given airport ICAO:
        
            >>> wxcast metar kden

        The data can be decoded and pretty printed to terminal using the
        -d/--decoded option.
        
            >>> wxcast metar -d kden
