Description: # ICMP remote shell
        Prototype of steganography remote shell using ICMP protocol for data
        hiding.
        
        To install packet use pip:
        
        `pip install icmp_remote_shell`
        
        Packet provides some common functions can be used in your ICMP
        steganography projects:
        
        - checksum - calculates packet checksum
        - send_one_ping - sends one ICMP packet
        - send_one - as previous but more convenient
        - start_sniffing - starts ICMP packets sniffer
        
        Packet also provides to commandline utils for creating remote shell.
        
        **icmp-remote-shell-client** - ICMP remote shell client
        
        Usage:
        
        `icmp-remote-shell-client host_out host_in \[ping_delay\] \[log_file\]`
        
        where:
        
        - host_out - The interface to send requests
        - host_in - The interface to listen replies
        - ping_delay - Delay between answer pings in seconds, default is 1
        - log_file - File to log server answers, default is /var/log/icmp_covert.log
        
        
        **icmp-remote-shell-server** - ICMP remote shell server
        
        Usage:
        
        `icmp-remote-shell-server host \[ping_delay\]`
        
        where:
        
        - host - The interface to listen request
        - ping_delay - Delay between answer pings in seconds, default is 1
        
        >Note: commands should run under user with privileges to send ICMP
        >messages only
