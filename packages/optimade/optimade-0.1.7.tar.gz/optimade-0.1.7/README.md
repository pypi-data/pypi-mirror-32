[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/materialsproject/optimade.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/materialsproject/optimade)

A library of tools for implementing and consuming
[OPTiMaDe](http://www.optimade.org) APIs in Python.

The aim of OPTiMaDe is to develop a common API, compliant
with the [JSON API 1.0](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/)
spec, to enable interoperability
among databases such as
[the Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org)
that contain calculated properties of
existing and hypothetical materials.

### Status
This library is under development. Progress is expected during the [CECAM Workshop on Open Databases Integration for Materials Design](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-4-1525.html) during the week of June 11, 2018 to June 15, 2018.
