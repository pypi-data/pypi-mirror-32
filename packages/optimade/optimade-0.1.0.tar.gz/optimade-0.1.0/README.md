A library of tools for implementing and consuming
[OPTiMaDe](http://www.optimade.org) APIs in Python.

The aim of OPTiMaDe is to develop a common API, compliant
with the [JSON API 1.0](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/)
spec, to enable interoperability
among databases such as
[the Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org)
that contain calculated properties of
existing and hypothetical materials.
