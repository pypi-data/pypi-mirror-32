RichDEM is a set of digital elevation model (DEM) hydrologic analysis tools.

RichDEM uses parallel processing and state of the art algorithms to quickly process even very large DEMs.

RichDEM offers a variety of flow metrics, such as D8 and D-infinity.

It can flood or breach depressions, as well as calculate flow accumulation, slopes, curvatures, &c.
