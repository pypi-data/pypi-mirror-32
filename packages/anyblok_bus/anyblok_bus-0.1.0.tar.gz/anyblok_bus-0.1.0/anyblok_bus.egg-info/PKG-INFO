        Front Matter
        ============
        
        Information about the AnyBlok / Bus project.
        
        Project Homepage
        ----------------
        
        AnyBlok is hosted on `github <http://github.com>`_ - the main project
        page is at https://github.com/AnyBlok/anyblok_bus. Source code is
        tracked here using `GIT <https://git-scm.com>`_.
        
        Releases and project status are available on Pypi at
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/anyblok_bus.
        
        The most recent published version of this documentation should be at
        http://doc.anyblok-bus.anyblok.org.
        
        Project Status
        --------------
        
        AnyBlok with bus is currently in beta status and is expected to be fairly
        stable.   Users should take care to report bugs and missing features on an as-needed
        basis.  It should be expected that the development version may be required
        for proper implementation of recently repaired issues in between releases;
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install released versions of AnyBlok from the Python package index with
        `pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ or a similar tool::
        
            pip install anyblok_bus
        
        Installation via source distribution is via the ``setup.py`` script::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Installation will add the ``anyblok`` commands to the environment.
        
        Unit Test
        ---------
        
        Run the test with ``nose``::
        
            pip install nose
            nosetests anyblok_bus/tests
        
        Script
        ------
        
        anyblok_bus add ``console_script`` to launch worker. A worker consume a queue defined
        by the decorator **anyblok_bus.bus_consumer**::
        
            anyblok_bus -c anyblok_config_file.cfg
        
        ..note:: The profile name in the configuration is used to find the correct url to connect to rabbitmq
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        AnyBlok / Bus works with **Python 3.3** and later and `pika <http://pika.readthedocs.io>`_. The install process will
        ensure that `AnyBlok <http://doc.anyblok.org>`_ is installed, in addition to other 
        dependencies. The latest version of them is strongly recommended.
