    fixes: ['mistralclient 3.5.0 introduced a new --force option to delete executions

        that are still running. However, this had the unintended impact of passing

        force=false when it wasn''t provided. This is incompatible with previous

        releases of the Mistral API which reject requests as they don''t recognise

        "force".

        it only

        finished executions can be deleted. If --force is passed the execution

        will be deleted but mistral will generate some errors as expected objects
