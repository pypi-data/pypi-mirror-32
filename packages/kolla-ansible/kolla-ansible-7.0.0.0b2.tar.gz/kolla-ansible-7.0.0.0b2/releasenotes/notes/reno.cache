        on remote

        Installing python packages directly to the system site-packages can cause

        various problems, in particular when pip overwrites a system package.

        Python virtualenvs are one solution to this issue, as they allow python

        packages to be installed in an isolated environment.  Typically we will

        need to enable use of system site-packages from within this virtualenv, to

        support the use of modules such as yum, apt, and selinux, which are not

        available on PyPI.


        The path to the virtualenv is configured via the ``virtualenv`` variable,

        and access to site-packages is controlled via ``virtualenv_site_packages``.

        The default value for ``virtualenv`` is None, in which case the old

        behaviour of installing packages directly to the system site-packages is

        maintained.


        When executing other kolla-ansible commands, the variable

        ``ansible_python_interpreter`` should be set to the python interpreter

        installed in ``virtualenv``. Note that this variable cannot be templated.
