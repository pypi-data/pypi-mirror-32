Bringing Transparency to online tracking - built by Cliqz and Ghostery.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains:

-  data on trackers and websites as shown on `whotracks.me`_ (WTM)
-  database mapping tracker domains to companies
-  code to render the `whotracks.me`_ site

Installation
============

Python 3.6 is needed to build the site. We recommend creating a
`virtualenv`_ (or ``pipenv``) to install the dependencies.

From Pypi
---------

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install whotracksme

From source
-----------

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install -e .

Thatâ€™s all you need to get started!

Using the data
==============

To get started with the data, everything you need can be found in
``whotracksme.data``:

.. code:: python

    from whotracksme.data.loader import DataSource

    data = DataSource()

    # available entities
    data.trackers
    data.companies
    data.sites

For examples of scripts, have a look in the `contrib`_ folder!

Building the site
=================

Building the site requires a few extra dependencies, not installed by
default to not make the installation heavier than it needs to be. You
will need to install ``whotracksme`` from the repository, because not
all assets are packaged with ``whotracksme`` released on pypi:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install -e '.[dev]'

Once this is done, you will have access to a ``whotracksme`` entry point
that can be used this way:

.. code:: sh

    $ whotracksme website [serve]

The ``serve`` part is optional and can be used while making changes on
the website.

All generated artifacts can be found in the ``_site/`` folder.

Tests
-----

To run tests, you will need ``pytest``, or simply install ``whotacksme``
with the ``dev`` extra:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install -e '.[dev]'
    $ pytest

Publishing a new version
========================

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install twine
    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    $ twine upload --username cliqz-oss dist/*
