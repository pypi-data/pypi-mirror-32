## How to use PLIP

#### 1. Clone the repository

Open a new system terminal and clone this repository using
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ssalentin/plip.git ~/pliptool
```
#### 2. Run PLIP

##### As a command line tool

Run the `plipcmd` script inside the PLIP folder to detect, report, and visualize interactions. The following example creates a PYMOL visualization for the interactions
between the inhibitor NFT and its target protein in the PDB structure 1VSN.

```bash
alias plip='~/pliptool/plip/plipcmd'
mkdir /tmp/1vsn && cd /tmp/1vsn
plip -i 1vsn -yv
pymol 1VSN_NFT_A_283.pse
```

##### As a python library

In your terminal, add the PLIP repository to your PYTHONPATH variable.
For our example, we also download a PDB file for testing.
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=~/pliptool:${PYTHONPATH}
cd /tmp && wget http://files.rcsb.org/download/1EVE.pdb
python
```
In python, import the PLIP modules, load a PDB structure and run the analysis.
This small example shows how to print all numbers of residues involved in pi-stacking:

```python
from plip.modules.preparation import PDBComplex

my_mol = PDBComplex()
my_mol.load_pdb('/tmp/1EVE.pdb') # Load the PDB file into PLIP class
print my_mol # Shows name of structure and ligand binding sites
my_bsid = 'E20:A:2001' # Unique binding site identifier (HetID:Chain:Position)
my_mol.analyze()
my_interactions = my_mol.interaction_sets[my_bsid] # Contains all interaction data

# Now print numbers of all residues taking part in pi-stacking
print [pistack.resnr for pistack in my_interactions.pistacking] # Prints [84, 129]
```

#### 3. View and process the results
PLIP offers various output formats, ranging from renderes images and PyMOL session files to human-readable text files and XML files.
By default, all files are deposited in the working directory unless and output path is provided.
For a full documentation of running options and output formats, please refear to the documentation.

## Versions and Branches
For production environments, you should use the latest versioned commit from the stable branch.
Newer commits from the stable and development branch may contains new but untested and not documented features.

## Requirements
Previous to using PLIP, make sure you have the following tools and libraries installed:
* Python 2.7.x
* OpenBabel >=2.3.2
* PyMOL 1.7.x with Python bindings (optional, for visualization only)
* Imagemagick >=6.9.x (optional)
