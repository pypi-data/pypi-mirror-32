    Tom Tomson received your invitation and was initially extremely hesistant
    about the whole thing.  The thing is, Tom had already heard about
    Interested civilians and it gave rose to all sorts of envious internal
    gnashings, because it just sounded way too close to his budding
    'awfully upright citizens 2.0' group. But late last night he came around
    after 2.5 minutes in the sensory depravation tank, and now he's on board.
