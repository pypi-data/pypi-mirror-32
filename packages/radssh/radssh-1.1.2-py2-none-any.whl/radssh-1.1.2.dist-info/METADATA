RadSSH is installable via **pip**, using "**pip install radssh**".

----


The RadSSH shell behaves similar to a normal ssh command line client, but instead of connecting to one host (at a time), you can connect to dozens or even hundreds at a time, and issue interactive command lines to all hosts at once. It requires very little learning curve to get started, and leverages on existing command line syntax that you already know. ::

RadSSH includes a loadable plugin facility to extend the functionality of the shell with basic Python scripting, as well as a high level API that can be used to build stand alone applications for dedicated SSH control processing in a parallel environment.
