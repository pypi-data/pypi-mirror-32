# Install MNIST packages

In this test we'll install two `mnist` packages - one under the `gpkg`
namespace (Guild's default namespace) and another under the `pypi`
namespace.

The package `mnist` contains MNIST models:

    >>> quiet("guild install mnist --pre")

The package `pypi.mnist` contains tools for working with MNIST
data. We don't use this package, but it illustrates how the Guild
packaging namespace is used to differentiate between packages of the
same name.

    >>> quiet("guild install pypi.mnist")
