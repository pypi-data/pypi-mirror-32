    "# Training\n",
    "MHCnuggets allows users to train their own models on their own datasets. The recommended protocol for trainning MHCnuggets utilizes transfer learning described in the publication. Briefly, one starts with training a model for HLA-A\\*02:01 and HLA-DRB1\\*01:01 for 100 epochs, then training all other alleles for 100 epochs with one of the aforementioned alleles as the base transfer weights, and finally, fine tuning certain alleles (refer to the `mhc_tuning.csv` file in the production data folders) for 25 epochs. Note that the transfer of weights occurs within the same MHC supertype, i.e. one can't tune the weights of a class II allele with a class I allele. This process is demonstrated below for the training for class I alleles: HLA-A\\*02:01, HLA-B\\*08:01, and HLA-B\\*08:02."
