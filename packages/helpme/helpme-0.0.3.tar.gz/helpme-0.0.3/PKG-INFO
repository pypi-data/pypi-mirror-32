        # Overview
        HelpMe is a general tool that can support the addition of helpers, or different
        modules that have a set of metadata to collect for the user, and based on an internal
        configuration file to define these metadata, and (if needed) an external config file
        for user variables, we send help requests to the various helpers. For example:
        
         - `helpme github` posts an issue on a Github board
         - `helpme uservoice` creates a ticket on uservoice
        
        We are fresh out of the oven! Please [post issues](https://www.github.com/vsoch/helpme/issues)
        with questions, feedback, or just to say hello. Hello!
        
        # Usage
        
        ```bash
        
        # Post an issue to a Github Repo.
        $ helpme github vsoch/helpme
        
        # Post a ticket to UserVoice
        $ helpme uservoice
        ```
