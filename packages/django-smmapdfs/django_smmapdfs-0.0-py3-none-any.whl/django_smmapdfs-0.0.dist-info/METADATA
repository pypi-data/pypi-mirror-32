smmapdfs: Sudo make me a pdf sandwich
=====================================

smmapdfs is used for generating pdf files from django models by overlaying the text of fields onto a background pdf file. It differs from other django pdf apps such as `django-easy-pdf <https://django-easy-pdf.readthedocs.io/en/v0.2.0-dev1/>`_ and `django-pdfkit <https://github.com/alexhayes/django-pdfkit>`_ in that it is intended to be used by graphics designers wishing to overlay some text onto a pre-prepaired pdf background.

smmapdfs can further be used to send out emails with the pdfs. It was initially intended to send out diplomas at the end of a cycling competition.

Integration:
------------

See the example app for an example of how to integrate smmapdfs into your django application.

Configuration:
--------------

In smmapdfs admin
- For each campaign add a new pdfsandwich type, uploading a PDF and setting its size. There can only be one pdfsandwich type per campaign
- For each pdfsandwich type and langauge add a pdfsandwich email
- For each pdfsandwich type add the fields you want displayed on the pdfsandwich, setting their coordinates in millimeters

Generating pdfsandwichs:
------------------------

In your application's admin
- Select the objects you wish to to generate pdfsandwichs for
- Select the Generate PdfSandwichs action

Sending pdfsandwichs:
---------------------

- In pdfsandwichs admin select the pdfsandwichs you want to send and use the send action

Generating pdfsandwichs using Celery:
-------------------------------------

- In the your application's admin select a parent object and use the Generate PdfSandwichs action

Sending pdfsandwichs using Celery:
----------------------------------

- In the pdfsandwichs admin select a pdfsandwich type and use the Send action


Hints:
------

It is a good idea to generate a pdfsandwich for yourself and send it to yourself before using the batch Celery method so as to test the process and the email formatting.

Notes about email formatting:
-----------------------------

The emails are sent as HTML messages. Text messages are created by stripping out the HTML tags. This means that links should be written in their full form.

SPAM
----

Please remember, both the United states and the EU have criminal penalties for sending unsolicited SPAM email messages. This app is not designed or intended for such a purpose. Please do not use it to send SPAM. (This note has no legal implications for licensing purposes. The software is licensed under the GNU LGPLv3.0)
