smmapdfs: Sudo make me a pdf sandwich
=====================================

smmapdfs is used for generating pdf files from django models by overlaying the text of fields onto a background pdf file. It differs from other django pdf apps such as `django-easy-pdf <https://django-easy-pdf.readthedocs.io/en/v0.2.0-dev1/>`_ and `django-pdfkit <https://github.com/alexhayes/django-pdfkit>`_ in that it is intended to be used by graphics designers wishing to overlay some text onto a pre-prepaired pdf background.

smmapdfs can further be used to send out emails with the pdfs. It was initially intended to send out diplomas at the end of a cycling competition.

It is a good idea to generate a pdfsandwich for yourself and send it to yourself before using the batch Celery method so as to test the process and the email formatting.

The emails are sent as HTML messages. Text messages are created by stripping out the HTML tags. This means that links should be written in their full form.
