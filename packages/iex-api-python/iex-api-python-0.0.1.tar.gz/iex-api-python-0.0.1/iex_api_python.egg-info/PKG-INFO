        __Python >=3.6__
        
        ### Summary
        
        __IEX-API-Python__ is a python wrapper for the [IEX API](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/). The __IEX API__ provides stock market data from the IEX exchange for free.
        
        Before using __IEX-API-Python__ and the __IEX API__ you should read the [API terms of use](https://iextrading.com/api-terms/) and review the [documentation](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/).
        
        ### Organization
        
        The `IEX-API-Python` module is designed to map closely to the API from IEX. For many of the API calls, the resulting dataset is better represented in a tabular format. For these calls, data are returned as a [pandas.DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html).
