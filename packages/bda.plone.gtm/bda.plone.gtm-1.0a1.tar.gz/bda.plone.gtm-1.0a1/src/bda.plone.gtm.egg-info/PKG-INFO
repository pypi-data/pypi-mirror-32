        bda.plone.gtm
        =============
        
        Google Tag Manager Integration.
        
        
        Installation and Configuration
        ==============================
        
        - Depend your installation to ``bda.plone.gtm``.
        
        - Install ``bda.plone.gtm`` via Plone Add-ons control panel.
        
        - Naviagte to "Site Setup" -> "Add-on Configuration" -> "Google Tag Manager Settings".
        
        - Set "Enabled" checkbox and enter "Container ID". Optionally edit "Layer Name"
          to your needs. This integration package handles the layer name properly.
          Anyway you need to be aware that any 3rd party JS using this package may
          depend hardcoded to the default layer name, so be careful with changing this
          setting.
        
        
        Providing Data
        ==============
        
        ``bda.plone.gtm`` by default tracks nothing. To track something useful,
        ``bda.plone.gtm.interfaces.IGTMData`` adapters needs to be provided for the
        relevant context.
        
        The adapter implementation looks like:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from a.package.interfaces import IMyContextInterface
            from bda.plone.gtm.interfaces import IGTMData
            from zope.component import adapter
            from zope.interface import implementer
        
            @implementer(IGTMData)
            @adapter(IMyContextInterface)
            class MyContextGTMData(object):
        
                def __init__(self, context):
                    self.context = context
        
                @property
                def data(self):
                    # data is a dict or a list of dicts.
                    return {
                        'pageTitle': 'Home',
                        'visitorType': 'high-value'
                    }
        
        Register the data adapter:
        
        .. code-block:: xml
        
            <configure xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope">
        
              <!-- GTM data adapter -->
              <adapter factory=".data.MyContextGTMData" />
        
            </configure>
