    Compare two DNA sequences.

    Note that including 'N' in the default gapChars results (obviously) in
    treating N as a gap. Although you could argue that those two things are
    not the same, for all practical purposes (or at least in the code below)
    they can be treated as if they are. We treat a '?' as a gap character
    too, as it is also completely ambiguous.  In the returned result, the
    gap information (mismatches, indices, etc) therefore include places where
    the sequences have an 'N'. If you don't want 'N' treated in this way, just
    pass a C{gapChars} value without it.

    @param read1: A C{Read} instance or an instance of one of its subclasses.
    @param read2: A C{Read} instance or an instance of one of its subclasses.
    @return: A C{dict} with information about the match and the individual
        sequences (see below).
