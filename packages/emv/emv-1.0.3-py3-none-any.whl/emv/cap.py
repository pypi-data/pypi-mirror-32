''' EMV Chip Authentication Program, a.k.a DPA, a.k.a Pinsentry.

    There is no public specification for the EMV CAP "standard". The code in this
    module is based on a number of other hacky projects. It works for Barclays
    cards in the UK. It will probably work for other UK cards as there is a
    UK-wide standard.

    I make no guarantees for non-UK cards as I'm aware that certain banks have
    made their own "customisations" to EMV CAP.
