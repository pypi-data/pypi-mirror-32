        Installation and usage
        ----------------------
        
        **Installation**
        Since this is a Python package available on PyPi you can install it like 
        any other Python package.
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            # on modern systems with Python you can install with pip
            $ pip install untappd_crawler
            # on older systems you can install using easy_install
            $ easy_install untappd_crawler
        
        **Usage**
        The commands should be mostly self-documenting in how they are defined,
        which is made available through the ``help`` command.
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            $ untappd_crawler
            usage: untappd_crawler -o <output_file_path> [-u <username>] [-b <beer_ids_repeated>]
        
            arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              Rest are in the help
