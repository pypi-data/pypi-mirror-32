::

    pip install cstat

If you want to get the latest features and fixes, you can also install it
directly from Github_.

::

    pip install git+https://github.com/chaudum/crate-top.git@master

Usage
=====

After installation you can monitor CrateDB running on localhost with default
configuration by invoking the following command::

    >>> cstat --user crate

A full list of command line arguments are listed when invoking ``cstat`` with
the ``--help`` argument::

    >>> cstat --help
    usage: cstat [-h] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--interval INTERVAL]
                 [--user USER] [--version]

    A visual stat tool for CrateDB clusters

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --host HOST, --crate-host HOST
                            CrateDB host to connect to
      --port PORT, --psql-port PORT
                            PSQL port of CrateDB host
      --interval INTERVAL, --refresh-interval INTERVAL
                            amount of time in seconds between each update
      --user USER, --db-user USER
                            database user
      --version             show program's version number and exit

By default ``cstat`` connects to ``localhost`` on port ``5432`` if not
otherwise specified.

Keyboard Shortcuts
==================

- ``0``  ... toggle cluster info
- ``1``  ... show utilization for CPU, process, memory, heap and disk
- ``2``  ... show I/O statistics for network and disk
- ``3``  ... show aggregated query duration based on jobs_log_
- ``x``  ... toggle nodes/aggregation view
- ``f3`` ... enable/disable job logging (this also sets the ``stats.jobs_log``
  cluster setting)

Known Issues
============

- Small terminal sizes will raise CanvasErrors because of content overflow.
