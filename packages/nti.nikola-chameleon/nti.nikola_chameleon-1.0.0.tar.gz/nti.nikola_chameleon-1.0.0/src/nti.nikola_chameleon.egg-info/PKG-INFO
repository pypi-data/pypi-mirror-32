        An extremely flexible template system for the `Nikola
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Nikola>`_ static blog system using
        `Chameleon <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Chameleon>`_, `z3c.pt
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.pt>`_ and `z3c.macro
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.macro>`_
        
        A basic template using this system is available in `base-chameleon
        <https://github.com/NextThought/nti.nikola_themes.base-chameleon>`_,
        and an extension of that using bootstrap3 is available in
        `bootstrap3-chameleon
        <https://github.com/NextThought/nti.nikola_themes.bootstrap3-chameleon>`_.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Nikola uses a `custom mechanism <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yapsy>`_
        to find plugins instead of using the usual ``pkg_resources`` system.
        That makes it *incredibly* difficult to install plugins; it's not enough
        just to ``pip install`` a package from PyPI. Instead, you must *also*
        copy a ``.plugin`` file to a particular location on disk. This can be:
        
        - ~/.nikola/plugins/
        - The ``plugins`` directory of your Nikola site.
        
        Beside that '.plugin' file there must also be a '.py' file of the same
        name that the plugin lists as a module (yes, even though the plugin file
        specifically requests a Python module, yapsy requires that it be a
        file or directory beside the plugin file---so not really a module).
        
        It's ridiculous to require everyone to copy plugins into their plugin
        folder (they're not even correctly on ``sys.path``, meaning that
        zope.configuration and many other tools won't work) and we don't plan
        to let Nikola do that automatically (we're not on the Nikola plugin
        index and won't be until they let us do standard installs), so the
        best we can do is attempt to workaround yapsy's limitations.
        
        Into your site's plugin directory, place the following .py file::
        
          # nti_nikola_chameleon.py
          from nti.nikola_chameleon import *
        
        
        Beside that, you'll need a ``nti.nikola_chameleon.plugin`` file::
        
          # -*- mode: conf; -*-

        =========
         Changes
        =========
        
        1.0.0 (2018-05-26)
        ==================
        
        - Posts that have a true value for ``has_math`` will now implement
          the ``IMathJaxPost`` interface when used as the context.
        - Index pages that have any posts using MathJax will now have a
          context object that implements ``IMathJaxPostList``.
        - Add a view for getting CSS data. Currently it has
          ``context/@@post_css/pagekind_class``.
        - Update to Nikola 8; drop support for Python 2.7.
        - Add ``interfaces.IRootPage`` which is added to pages for which the
          metadata field ``nti-extra-page-kind`` is set to ``root``.
        - Make the ``featured`` list available to all pages, not just index
          pages. Together with the IRootPage this can be used to promote blog
          posts to the root index.html.
        - Add ``embedded_content`` to the ``@@post_text`` view.
        - Initial support for template-based shortcodes. See
          https://github.com/NextThought/nti.nikola_chameleon/issues/5
        
        0.0.1a2 (2017-10-14)
        ====================
        
        - Map the Nikola ``messages`` function onto the native ``i18n``
          functionality of Chamleon. Attributes like ``i18n:translate`` are
          now preferred to explicit calls to ``options/messages`` when
          possible.
        
        - Add support for viewlets. Several default viewlet managers are
          supplied, and a ZCML directive ``<browser:newViewletManager>`` is
          provided so themes can create new viewlet managers::
        
            <browser:newViewletManager id="ILeftColumn" />
            <browser:viewletManager
                name="left_column"
                provides=".viewlets.ILeftColumn" />
        
        - Add a path adapter to easily get formatted dates from a post, either
          a static format (``post/formatted_date:webiso``) or dynamically from
          a variable (``post/formatted_date:?date_format``).
        
        - Add a view to get the text of a post, respecting teaser settings:
          ``post/@@post_text/content``.
        
        - Move feed support to a ``@@feeds`` view for headers, and a viewlet
          for body::
        
           <browser:viewlet
              name="feed_content_header"
              manager=".interfaces.IHtmlBodyContentHeaderViewletManager"
              class=".feeds.HTMLFeedLinkViewlet"
              layer=".interfaces.IAuthorPageKind"
              permission="zope.Public"
              weight="1"
              classification_name="author"
              />
        
        - Add a view interface (``ICommentKind``) for comment systems. Only Disqus is
          currently supported. Note that this may move in the future to be a layer.
        
        0.0.1a1 (2017-10-09)
        ====================
        
        - Preliminary PyPI release. While this package is functional, it is
          not yet documented sufficiently to be of general use. It is also not
          expected to be fully stable.
