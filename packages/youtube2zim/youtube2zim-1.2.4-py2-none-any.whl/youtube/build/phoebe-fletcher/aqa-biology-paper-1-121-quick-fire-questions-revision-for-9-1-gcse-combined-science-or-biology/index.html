I don't have any insider knowledge just years of looking at exam papers. Use this as a starting point, but revise EVERYTHING fully. The best way to revise is to get your hands on the past papers and marks schemes (freely available on the exam board website) and look at what questions have been asked and how to answer them. I have lots of notes and exam papers on here to help you.<br><br>Disclaimer; You should not carry out any of these practical’s without carrying out a full risk assessment of your own first. Just watching these video will not guarantee to get you a good grade, you’ll also need hard work, this is not a quick fix. I am human and I make mistakes, please point out any that you find and there is no need to follow that with a load of abuse.<br><br>Some of the links in here are affiliate links, where is get a small percentage of any money spent, if you like my channel and want to support my work, clicking these is an easy way to do it.<br><br>The 'whole of topic in xxx minutes' videos DO NOT comprehensively cover everything you need to know for your exams. it would be impossible to cover 2 years of teaching in under 45 minutes. These should NOT be your only source of revision https://youtu.be/K6d4oOq-pmU  xoxox<br><br>PhET Interactive Simulations<br>University of Colorado Boulder<br>https://phet.colorado.edu<br><br>Music; Something Elated by Broke For Free.
