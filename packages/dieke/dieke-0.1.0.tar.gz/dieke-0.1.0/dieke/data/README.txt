These datafiles were downloaded from:

http://www.cse.anl.gov/OldCHMwebsiteContent/downloads/data/index.html

 - The file f12mp.dat on that site is corrupted, so I have named it "f12mp.dat.broken". I found a 'fixed' copy in the source of Mike Reid's linuxemp program and that is here as f12mp.dat.
- But that file was a bit broken so I added "T2  T3" to the end of some lines that looked like they needed it!
