`Hyperdash`_ is a machine learning monitoring library capable of running alongside Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn, and other modeling libraries. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast knowledge gain.

Use Hyperdash if you're looking for cloud-based model monitoring that:

* Is fast and easy-to-use with scripts and Jupyter.
* Tracks your hyperparameters across different model experiments.
* Graphs performance metrics (loss, reward, etc.) in real-time.
* Can be viewed remotely on the `Web`_, `iOS`_, and `Android`_ without self-hosting (e.g. Tensorboard).
* Saves your experiment's print output (standard out / error) as a local log file.
* Notifies you when a long-running experiment has finished.

Hyperdash is compatible with: **Python 2.7 - 3.6**
