Description: This project provides tools for estimating the number of metastable states, rate
        constants between the states, equilibrium populations, distributions
        characterizing the states, and distributions of these quantities from
        single-molecule data. This data could be FRET data, single-molecule pulling
        data, or any data where one or more observables are recorded as a function of
        time. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used to interpret the observed dynamics,
        and a distribution of models that fit the data is sampled using Bayesian
        inference techniques and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), allowing for both the
        characterization of uncertainties in the model and modeling of the expected
        information gain by new experiments.
